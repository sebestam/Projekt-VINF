This Nocturne is composed of two themes that are repeated in what is known as a rounded binary form, or A-A-B-A-B-A. The themes become more elaborate each time they're played, with more trills, cadenzas and quick runs. Throughout the whole piece, Chopin uses the same kind of bass-chord accompaniment, forming a harmonically rich and stable foundation for the fluid melody. After the last occurrence of the ""A"" theme, there follows a coda which at first seems bound to end the piece in a peaceful way, but instead builds up to a great, passionate climax marked fortissimo. After an intense trill the calm is restored and the piece ends very quietly. | Background: This Nocturne is the second in a set of three written between 1830 and 1832, when Chopin was about twenty years old. His pupil Wilhelm von Lenz recalls an amusing story: ""I tormented Chopin most with the famous Nocturne in E flat major, Op. 9 - in 1842 it was in the full bloom of fashion - When Chopin was pleased with a scholar, he, with a small, well-sharpened pencil, made a cross under the composition. I had received one, in the Nocturne; next time I came, I got another. I came still another time. 'Do please let me alone,' said Chopin - 'there, you have another cross, more than three I never give. You cannot do it any better!' 'You play it so beautifully,' I ventured, 'can no one else?' 'Liszt can,' said Chopin, drily, and played it to me no more."" | Practice & Performance Tips:: The left hand provides the important foundation for the melody; without a flowing and balanced accompaniment, it is impossible to execute the cantabile line of the right hand beautifully. Play quickly enough to be able to feel four rather than twelve beats to every bar; this will help you shape the melody more naturally.Use graceful, flowing movements, and an elegantly flexible rubato, without ever losing sight of the underlying steady pulse. Finally find the correct balance between the hands: play the left hand softly enough to be able to make the right hand sing without using too much...

Contrary to popular opinion, 4-year-old Mozart did not compose the original song. It’s a French song that Mozart turned into this wonderful set of variations in 1782 when he was 25 years old, in order to use during lessons with his students. For some reason, Mozart didn’t publish the piece until three years later.

https://www.pianostreet.com/bach-sheet-music/goldberg-variations-g-major.htm,Johann Sebastian Bach,Goldberg Variations,"The relentlessly intricate architecture of the Goldberg Variations still engages scholars after hundreds of years, while the soothing, noble poetry and formidable technical demands of the piece continue to captivate players and listeners.",,G Major,1741,8+,Baroque,"Comfort for insomniacs?: The Goldberg Variations opens and closes with the heavenly beautiful ""Aria"" - an ornate, noble Sarabande. Rather than just varying the melody of the Aria, the thirty variations are built upon its bass line. Every third variation is a canon at increasing intervals, except the final, thirtieth variation, a so-called quodlibet, mixing a number of popular tunes - including one that goes ""Cabbage and turnips have driven me away, had my mother cooked meat, I'd have opted to stay"". The variations found just after each canon are genre pieces of various types, often based one Baroque dances. The variations preceding the canons are variations in lively tempo with a great deal of hand-crossing. This ternary pattern—canon, genre piece, virtuoso ""arabesque""—is repeated a total of nine times, until the Quodlibet breaks the cycle. Bach wrote the work with a two-manual harpsichord in mind (the score specifies for each variation if it is meant to be played on one or two manuals), which makes the challenge for the pianist even greater – the many hand-crossings, possibly inspired by Scarlatti's keyboard music, is much easier to perform on two manuals. | Background: Johann Nicolaus Forkel wrote in his Bach biography (1802) that the Goldberg Variations had been commissioned by the Russian Ambassador to Saxony Count Kaiserling, who suffered from insomnia. Goldberg was a young musician, who according to Forkel's (probably spurious) version of events, was supposed to play from the Variations during the Count's sleepless nights to cheer him up a little. A number of legendary performances of this monumental work have been recorded on piano as well as on harpsichord and organ - two of the most popular and highly regarded ones were recorded on the piano by Glenn Gould in 1955 and 1981.","Piano sheet music and recordings.

Its joyous character and fast ornamental patterns has made it one of Mozart's most popular piano pieces.",,A Minor,-,7,Classical,"Battle music for zurna and zil: Many would rank this as the single most effective movement in all of Mozart's piano sonatas. It has a quite unusual, complex form which is not immediately recognisable as the standard classical Rondo. Taken in very large chunks, it is constructed in an A-B-A-B-coda form, where each letter has several smaller sections inside. The A section is in the minor mode, and the B section plus coda in A major, like the two other movements of the sonata. This music is supposed to suggest an exotic military marching band, and so the character is something in between triumphant, showy and humorous. While the left hand uses pretty basic patterns of divided chords and occasional spread octaves, the right-hand engages in much delicate fingerwork, alternating with blocked and broken octaves. | Background: The army music of the 17th century Ottoman Turkish Empire was something that inspired several Western composers, not only Mozart but also Haydn, Beethoven, Jean- Baptiste Lully and others. In the west, this was often called Janissary music, after the elite troups of the Sultan, the yeniçeri. Common instruments in a Janissary band were the zurna (a very loud, oboe-like double-reed), a boru (a trumpet), the nakkare (small kettledrums), the davul (a large bass drum), and the zil (cymbals); loud percussion and piercing wind instruments, designed to be heard on the battlefield. In Mozart's time, when imitating this kind of music at the keyboard, it was not unusual to make use of a so called Turkish stop, a pedal that caused a bell to ring and/or a padded hammer to strike the soundboard in imitation of a bass drum. Illustration of Janissary music on YouTube | Practice & Performance Tips:: Don't feel forced to play this movement extremely fast, even if that is what you hear in several recordings. After all, the tempo marking is Allegretto, not Allegro or Presto. Keep a steady pulse throughout; remember that the music is supposed to suggest a marching military band! Play clearly and lightly in the sections marked piano (eighth-notes staccato), and save the heavier touch as well as the right pedal for the octave sections and the coda.

https://www.pianostreet.com/debussy-sheet-music/suite-bergamasque/clair-de-lune-moonlight-3.htm,Claude Debussy,Clair de Lune No. 3 from Suite Bergamasque,"With its ethereal mood and sense of mystery, Clair de Lune beautifully evokes Verlaine’s lines about “the sad and lovely moonlight that sets the birds dreaming in the trees”.",Suite Bergamasque,D-flat Major,1890 (publ. 1905),7,Impressionism,"Mysterious masqueraders: Debussy's most famous piano piece sounds very fluid and soft contoured, much like a landscape seen in Moonlight. The paradox is that here, as in most of Debussy's music, much careful attention needs to be directed towards rhythmic accuracy and the many precise markings in the score, in order to arrive at a performance that sounds like it's truly floating in the air. Apart from a couple of brief climaxes, the dynamic range stays within p to ppp, placing high demands on exactness of touch, voicing and colour. The title alludes to the eponymous poem by Verlaine: Moonlight Your soul is a select landscape Where charming masqueraders and bergamaskers go Playing the lute and dancing and almost Sad beneath their fantastic disguises. All sing in a minor key Of victorious love and the opportune life, They do not seem to believe in their happiness And their song mingles with the moonlight, With the still moonlight, sad and beautiful, That sets the birds dreaming in the trees And the fountains sobbing in ecstasy, The tall slender fountains among marble statues. Paul Verlaine, 1869 | Background: The poem by Verlaine which inspired Suite Bergamasque, has given its name also to the suite's most popular piece. Indeed, Clair de Lune (Moonlight) is often said to be the most famous of all Debussy's works. Its name was changed from Promenade Sentimentale only shortly before publication, to indicate the connection of this music with the Symbolist movement, of which Verlaine was one of the leaders. Reacting against realism, a typical ""daylight"" form of literature, the Symbolists tried to illuminate more inaccessible regions of the human soul, through creating suggestive images and evoking moods. The moon naturally became their favourite symbol, spreading as it does a mysterious, indirect light on the dark side of the earth.",Debussy: Clair de Lune (moonlight) No. 3 in D-flat Major (published in 1905) .

https://www.pianostreet.com/chopin-sheet-music/impromptus/fantaisie-impromptu-op-66.htm,Frédéric Chopin,"Fantaisie-Impromptu in C-sharp Minor, Op. 66","It's easy to see why the Fantaisie-Impromptu is among Chopin's most popular works. The sweeping melody of soaring sixteenth notes is hard, but fun, to play - and exciting to listen to.",Impromptus,C-sharp Minor,1834 (publ. 1855),8+,Early Romantic,"Sweeping brilliance, saved from the fire: The Fantaisie-Impromptu is a piece in ABA form. The A section has a sweeping melody of sixteenth notes running up and down the keyboard, accompanied by triplet arpeggios in the left hand. It's very fast and sounds almost a little chaotic, while the softer middle section with its wonderful cantilena provides a good overall balance to the piece. The coda begins passionately, but calms down little by little, reintroducing the theme from the middle section in the left hand. The three-against four cross-rhythm of the fast section may initially seem daunting to less experienced pianists, but becomes easier as each hand acquires the necessary speed. The hairpins in bar 5 and 6 of the otherwise sketch-like original text of the first version underline the importance of giving expressive shape to the cascade of right-hand notes. | Background: Fantasie Impromptu was composed around 1834, but published only after the composer's death, contrary to his express wish that all unpublished works and sketches should be burned. Until 1962, when Arthur Rubinstein published a new edition, based on an autograph which he had sensationally found, the piece was known only in the form of Julian Fontana's 1855 edition, which contained significant alterations and additions to the composer's text. All modern Urtext editions, including the Polish National Chopin Edition, base their editions on Rubinstein's find. It is interesting to note that the middle section was used in the song I'm Always Chasing Rainbows, which was a very popular song in 1918. | Practice & Performance Tips:: The cross-rhythms (sixteenth-notes against triplets) and the incredibly fast right hand figurations in the first section of this piece may seem daunting, and this is certainly not a piece for the beginner or even intermediate player. However, the Fantaise-Impromptu is not one of Chopin's most difficult pieces. The piano writing makes amazing use of very natural movements, and there is no great awkwardness for anyone with a normal-sized hand. As for the coordination problem, it also more or less solves itself if each hand is mastered separately and the pianist keeps focusing on a flowing alla breve pulse. Note that the Largo marking only applies to measures 41 and 42; the rest of the middle section is marked Moderato cantabile, which should mean a rather flowing tempo.

Its musical content is really simple and could perhaps even be called thin, but so far it hasn’t lost any of its massive effect, and promises to live on and speak as powerfully to future generations. The atmosphere of the first section may be likened to a solemn procession or ritual; in contrast, the chromatic sequential phrases in the second section (measures 14-42) are almost frantic. When the first theme returns, it is in “a mood of grandeur and power, as if illustrating the inevitable survival of some great and mighty truth” (Godowsky), but the Coda returns to the mysterious and reflective atmosphere - as if the question posed at the beginning is left unanswered after all. “...One day the prelude simply came and I put it down. It came with such force that I could not shake it off even though I tried to do so. It had to be - so there it was” | Background: Rachmaninoff composed the Prelude in C-sharp minor in the late summer of 1892, at the age of 18, and first performed it at the Moscow Electric Exhibition in September of 1892. This was the beginning of the career of one of the world’s most popular piano pieces - it shortly became known simply as ""The Prelude.""

https://www.pianostreet.com/beethoven-sheet-music/fur-elise-a-minor.htm,Ludwig van Beethoven,Für Elise in A Minor,"The graceful, meandering simplicity of this slightly melancholy music never loses its charm. The opening phrase is one of the best known motifs in classical music.",,A Minor,1810,5,Classical,"The mysterious Elise: Für Elise (or Bagatelle in A minor WoO 59) is a rondo with two episodes - the form can be described as A-B-A-C-A. Its beautiful sequence of continuous rolled chords divided between the hands is one of the most well-known piano themes of all time. One of the things that makes this piece so hypnotic is the stubborn sixteenth note movement, continued almost throughout the piece, and only changed at a couple of very strategic places for maximum effect. There are two short passages where the speed of the notes increases: the first episode has five bars with thirty-seconds, and the second episode has five bars with sixteenth-note triplets. In connection with these passages, there are also two places where the continuous movement is stopped (bars 35-36 and 75-76). In addition, there is the very peculiar jumping E octaves towards the end of the A section. All this adds to the impression that the music is somehow trying to break free from its melancholy meanderings, but is always reined in by the recurring E-D# motif. | Background: The piece was composed in Beethoven's middle period. The discoverer of the piece, Ludwig Nohl, affirmed that the original autographed manuscript, now lost, was dated 27 April 1810. However, it was not published until 1865, several decades after the composer's death, by the Beethoven scholar Ludwig Nohl. The title, meaning ""To Elise"", has puzzled Beethoven researchers. There is no record of any woman named Elise in Beethoven's life, and the fact that the original autograph manuscript is missing has fueled speculation. One of the most established theories, suggested by Max Unger, is that Nohl misread the dedication, and that Beethoven intended to name the piece ""Für Therese"". Around 1810, Beethoven was in love with a woman called Therese Malfatti, and even proposed to her, but was rejected. The other main theory is that Elise might have been a nickname for the opera singer Elisabeth Röckel, Beethoven's close friend, who later married the composer Johann Nepomuk Hummel. | Practice & Performance Tips:: Because of its great popularity, Für Elise is perhaps played and taught more than any other piano piece. For many piano beginners, its an important goal to be able to play at least the first section. And the first 22 measures are certainly playable even for someone with quite limited skills. To be able to perform the complete work, one should have acquired a more solid technique. Since the only dynamic indication of the score is pp (measures 1 and 77), it’s suitable to use a rather subdued and soft touch more or less throughout, although one is of course free to add slight crescendos and diminuendos, perhaps even approach a forte in the dramatic episode at measures 60-76 (before the return to pianissimo). Strive to keep a consistent speed through the various sections. Make sure not to play the characteristic E-D#-E-D#-E figures mechanically; instead, shape them with great care, always adhering to the graceful flow of the 3/8 time...

Petzold) in G Major, BWV Anh. 114 from Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach","In the lives of countless piano students, this little Minuet has represented their first meeting with Bach. But we don't even know if Bach composed it!",Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach,G Major,1725,2,Baroque,"Bach or Petzold?: Whoever composed this little Minuet, its simplicity and straightforwardness is arresting. The dancing character and the way the composer uses and varies the simple motive of the first two measures throughout the piece is very characteristic of the Baroque era. The right hand is almost written as a five-finger exercise, but it represents an elegance rare among such practice-pieces. The left hand mostly provides simple bass- and leading notes, but in one or two places there is a foretaste of the imitation and finger coordination required for Bach's more advanced pieces. | Background: Scholars seem to be more or less agreed that the Minuet in G from Anna Magdalena Bach's Notebook is more likely to have been penned by Bach’s colleague, the organist and composer Christian Petzold (1677-1723). The notebook functioned as a kind of musical diary, into which Bach’s wife Anna magdalena copied pieces composed by her husband and others, sometimes without indicating authorship. | Practice & Performance Tips:: The minuet is the most common dance in the Baroque period. At that time, the ladies wore a very long, puffy, heavy dress, with which they could not move too quickly. Remember that when playing minuets! Can you play them in a very charming manner and with a very steady pulse, without rushing? PHRASES Practice this minuet by phrases. There are four 8-bar phrases in this dance. The first phrase is very similar to the second phrase. Circle the different measures in both phrases. Compare and practice the measures that are different first. PRACTICING HANDS APART It is very important to practice hands separately. Each hand should be treated as an independent voice. Try to sing along as you play each voice (or each hand). If you can memorize each voice first, you will play the voices really well when you put hands together. Mm. 25-26: notice the addition of a third voice here. You do have to hold the half-notes as if you were playing a duet with only one hand! This is a great moment for you to vary the sound and play these and the next two measures piano. ARTICULATION Baroque composers rarely marked articulations (slurs and staccato) on their music. But it was common practice to normally play eighth-notes...

https://www.pianostreet.com/bach-sheet-music/small-preludes-and-fuguettas/small-prelude-c-major.htm,Johann Sebastian Bach,Small Prelude in C Major,"The most well-known of the ""Small Preludes"" is an excellent introduction to several aspects of Bach's music: the conversational style, chordal structures and his use of dynamic effects.",Small Preludes and Fughettas,C Major,1727,3,Baroque,"A small prelude that sounds big: Like so much of Bach's music, this piece uses a lot of imitation. It also gives an excellent opportunity to study chordal structures, and to listen for dynamic effects in Baroque keyboard music. Dynamic marks are rare in Bach (those in the scanned score were added by the editor). Instead, dynamics are built into the music through changes of register and texture. The broken chord theme of this Prelude is played at different pitches and with different kinds of accompaniment, to add variety and rhythmic vitality. Near the end, Bach changes the texture almost at every bar-line, which adds to the sense of a long crescendo throughout the piece. All these perfectly balanced changes of rhythm, pitch and texture give Bach’s music all the contrast and variety it needs, whether performed on the harpsichord or the modern piano. | Background: This Prelude is one of 12 ‘Small preludes’ written separately at different times in Bach’s life for pedagogical purposes. They were collected partly from the ""Clavierbüchlein for Wilhelm Friedemann Bach"" and partly from manuscripts owned by Johan Peter Kellner, a German organist contemporary with Bach. | Practice & Performance Tips:: This prelude starts with a C-pedal point, which reminds us of the organ. Imagine the sound of an organ when you start this prelude. This pedal point lasts for 3 measures! Can you put a bracket above the first 8 notes written on the treble staff ? These notes form the thematic material that Bach used to compose the entire prelude. What is the chord outlined by these notes that you bracketed? It is a C7 chord. Study the next group of 8 notes. It forms an F chord, which is followed by a G7 chord. Bach uses imitation on the left hand in m. 4. It is the same thematic material presented by the right hand but the C chord in m. 4 is followed by a D chord in m. 5. In mm. 8-12, the thematic material goes back to the right hand while quarter notes on the left hand add rhythmic vitality to the never-changing G pedal. The mordent highlights this G pedal and helps give variety to the theme. Practice mm. 9-12 without the mordent first. Then, add the mordent but drop the low G. In other words, do not play the G on beats 2 and 4 and check if your right hand can continue playing the thematic material without any stops or bumps. If there are no bumps, false accents or hesitation, add the low G that you dropped, playing the passage as written. ...

It’s popularity spans different genres, and even the Swingle Singers did an upbeat jazz version in much the same way as they had done “Wachet Auf,” which is “Sleeper’s Wake” in English. The best-known piano transcription was made in 1926 by Dame Myra Hess. This edition presents a slightly easier version with fewer notes and less wide stretches. | Background: The original “Jesus bleibet meine Freude” is the concluding movement of a church cantata (Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben, BWV 147) dating from 1723, Bach's first year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. Bach often composed four-part chorales to end a cantata.

For three years, he basically did nothing. Then, inspiration struck him again, and the second piano concerto was the result. Unlike the first symphony, the second concerto became a favorite of performers and audience members alike. Interestingly enough, it was when Rachmaninoff visited a hypnotist that he recovered his desire to compose. From January to April 1900, he visited Nikolai Dahl, a neurologist who specialized in hypnosis, daily. Himself a musician, Dahl would repeat a triptych formula while the composer was half-asleep: ""You will begin to write your concerto ... You will work with great facility ... The concerto will be of an excellent quality"". The premiere of the work was fraught with danger. On the eve of the concert, Rachmaninoff caught a cold, prompting his friends and relatives to stuff him with remedies, including an excess of mulled wine. It had been eight years since he performed as a soloist with orchestra. Still, it was an enormous success and propelled Rachmaninoff right back into the thick of things. The critic Ivan Lipaev wrote: ""it's been long since the walls of the Nobility Hall reverberated with such enthusiastic, storming applause as on that evening ...

Grieg sets the somber, repetitive theme against a chromatic bass-line sliding downward, containing the first eight bars - marked piano and molto legato - within one long slur. The range of expression contained in the 14 variations that follow is astounding. They range from rather simple elaborations of the theme to deeply contrasting and daring excursions into widely differing characters and styles – there are canons, recitative-like passages, a sombre lento, light and witty scherzando variations as well as Lisztian, extremely forceful outbursts. The last four variations are cast as continuous sections of one large Finale. The juxtaposition of ancient folksong and late-Romantic harmony gives this piece its unique atmosphere, creating the effect of a great abyss of time. The Ballade apparently had a very special emotional meaning for Grieg. He said that it was written “with my life’s blood in days of sorrow and despair.” After his parents’ death in the autumn of 1875, Grieg was in a period of depression which was also caused by problems in his relationship with his wife Nina. | Background: The theme of the Ballade was sung to Kirstine Aas’s poem Den nordlandske bondestand (The North Country Peasantry), and taken by Grieg from Ludwig Matthias Lindeman’s collection Ældre og nyere Fjeldmelodier (Mountain Tunes New and Old), published in 1858. In reality, however, the melody is several hundred years older than that. Grieg never performed this work in public, but in 1876, he played it in a private performance for Dr. Max Abraham, director of the Peters publishing firm. According to witnesses, he put his entire soul into the interpretation – when he was finished, he was completely exhausted, and so agitated and shaken that he could not say a word for a long time afterwards.",Ballade in the Form of Variations on a Norwegian Folk Song Op. 24 in G Minor (published in 1875) by Edvard Grieg - piano sheet music to download and print instantly.

The somber introduction and the aria-like melody that follows belong to Mozart’s most despairing moments. The heavy, chromatically descending octaves of measures 20-22 seems to take us to the gloomiest regions of the human soul. After sections of nervously palpitating music, and dramatic outbursts covering the entire range of the keyboard, suddenly the mode changes to D major, giving to this piece a surprisingly joyful and relaxed ending. The fantasy-character is underlined by the many silences, fermatas and mood changes. The pianist has to grasp all these different parts and make them into a convincing, coherent performance, as if reenacting Mozart's improvisation. The time signature in the D minor section is alla breve or cut time. In other words, the beat is counted in half-notes, so every bar has only two (slow) beats. The pianist that keeps this in mind will have an easier time shaping the music beautifully, especially the melody at the start of the Adagio section. There are many two-note slurs throughout the piece. Accents on the first note in these slurred pairs make them sound like expressive sighs. | Background: The Fantasy was only published after Mozart’s death, and the manuscript has been lost. In the first edition, the piece ended at the fermata in bar 97. Whether Mozart had intended to continue the Fantasy or attach it to a Sonata or Fugue remains unclear. In the Breitkopf & Härtel edition that appeared a few years later, ten concluding bars in D major, probably composed by the editor, appeared. This ending has been republished in practically every edition ever since, and are included in the vast majority of recordings of the piece. Mitsuko Uchida was probably the first recording artist to provide an alternative ending, returning to D minor and the arpeggiated chords of the beginning. Hélène Grimaud stops at the fermata and uses the Fantasy as an introduction on her recording of the D minor Concerto K. 466. | Practice & Performance Tips:: Introduction Think of the first note of this introduction (low D) as a seed that starts to germinate and take shape. It is interesting that Mozart writes the bass line (downbeats) with long notes. This is called ""finger pedal"" and makes the harmonies ring more without the performer having to use too much pedal. Practice all the arpeggios by blocking the notes to form chords. Blocking chords will help with memorization and also with shaping. Try to hear the chord progression outlined here and strive to shape this introduction that ends on the dominant chord (an important chord that prepares the listener for the theme). Adagio Remember that the term Adagio means &ldquo;at ease&rdquo;. Try to feel this section in two (remember that the time signature is 2/2, cut-time). Mozart loved hearing and writing operas. He was definitely thinking about an aria when he wrote this beautiful melodic line. Give a singing tone to your melody while your left hand holds the bass notes (the composer is using the finger pedal technique again!). Moreover, can you play the double notes in the left hand lightly? The soft touch here will provide just the right atmosphere in the background while the right hand will...

This is one of the most well-known and also one of the saddest: Chopin himself requested that it should be played at his funeral.,Preludes,E Minor,1834,5,Early Romantic,"Farewell music?: The Prelude in E minor is a one of Chopin's most accessible pieces, but also a musically very sophisticated work. It's a sad and mournful piece, ""the languid pensiveness of which defies description. It seems to shut out the wide, noisy world, for a time."" (Friedrich Niecks) With its minor key, chromatically descending chords and the fact that it's intended to ""die away"" as per Chopin's notation, it conveys an almost overwhelming sense of despair. While the notes are few and quite easy to find for the intermediate pianist, the shaping, coloring and pacing of this unique melody is worth a lifetime of study. | Background: Chopin's set of 24 preludes were first published in 1839 and dedicated to the composer Joseph Christoph Kessler. They received quite some criticism for their brief length and lack of any traditional structure; they were seen as more like sketches or brief notes as opposed to fully-formed ideas. However, there were also some, more forward-looking contemporaries, among them Robert Schumann, who admired them intensely.

But because of the perfection with which Bach has put these simple building blocks together, many find that they can play or listen to this piece thousands of times without ever tiring of it. The music is not just a sequence of chords but it has several melodic lines with their own, individual itinerary - a bass line, a melodic line, and lines in between. When you start noticing these, the musical roadmap of the piece gets even clearer. On a modern piano, the sensitive musician will voice the individual chords and balance subsequent chords against each other with subtle dynamic changes to bring out the inexorability of the harmonic progression. | Background: The C major prelude has served as an inspiration for many later composers. For example, it was used as the accompaniment for Gounod’s setting of Ave Maria, and Chopin alluded to it in his first etude for piano, op. 10 no 1. | Practice & Performance Tips:: Bach probably played this piece as a chorale first and then broke the chords into arpeggios. In order to understand the harmonic structure of this piece, play the chord progressions first. If possible, write down the label for each harmony. Play each group of sixteenth-notes (semiquavers) as a chord, making the piece sound like a chorale. While you play this piece in chords, listen to the bass line. In fact, it is useful to play, hear and also sing the bass line alone! Find the highest note in each measure for the right hand. This will become the ""melody"". After you found this ""melody"", play it many times alone (without the other notes). Then, add the bass line (left hand). See how the lines relate to each other. Are they in contrary motion? Parallel motion? Or does the bass stay the same and the top line moves? This will also help you memorize this prelude more easily.

The fiery Prelude is not only striking but can also serve as an excellent and musically rewarding Etude, demanding well-developed finger coordination to play with command and musical finish. In a similar fashion to the Prelude in C major which precedes it, it uses a repeating motif of notes to which a chord progression descending the piano is applied, adding a tricky coda marked Presto, and even a short recitativo before the piece comes to a close. The catchy and dance-like Fugue is one of the easier fugues of the Well-Tempered Clavier. During its exposition, it introduces the subject and two countersubjects which remain faithful companions through subsequent subject entries. Its structure is clearly delineated, alternating these entries with episodes featuring sequences of material derived from the subject and countersubject throughout the piece. At the end comes a so-called “pedal point” – an octave-reinforced C held over multiple bars underlining the final entry of the subject, creating some delicious dissonances before the final resolution to a Picardy third. | Background: An early version of the c minor prelude appears in the “Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach” (“Notebook for Wilhelm Friedemann Bach”), a collection of keyboard pieces Bach compiled for his son Wilhelm Friedemann in 1720.

He considered it the most difficult of all Chopin etudes, which says a lot about its challenges. One might be fooled into thinking otherwise because of the seemingly simple texture and extremely sparse left hand. Its harmonies resemble a chorale and it seems that Chopin wanted to start his collection of etudes with a reference to Bach's prelude No. 1 in C major from the Well-Tempered Clavier. But to execute these widely spaced arpeggios at the speed that Chopin is asking for, and with the smooth legato that Chopin intended, you need to have an extremely well-oiled technique and incredible stamina. Chopin almost never named his compositions, and instead referred to them by opus and number. However, many of the etudes have been given nicknames by others, for pedagogic or marketing reasons. Because of its ceaseless cascading arpeggios, this etude is sometimes referred to as the ""Waterfall"". | Background: Chopin's first set of etudes signifies a complete overhaul of the etude genre, transforming it from technical drudgery to a true art form with rich emotional and musical content, which at the same time takes piano technique to new heights.

A heroic, fanfare-like melody is played by the right hand while the left hand creates an impression of chaos and intensity by making continuous fast runs up and down the keyboard. One of the more interesting aspects of the piece is its abrupt ending. It ends with a descending sweep in both hands that arrives at a C major chord, supposedly brighter and more positive-sounding than the rest of the piece, which is in c minor. However, the arrival of this chord is so abrupt that the effect is anything but soothing. An unexpected touch to one of Chopin's most intense works, and possibly an allusion to the end of the first movement of Beethoven’s Sonata op 111, which Chopin is known to have admired. | Background: The ""Revolutionary"" Etude is the twelfth and last piece in Chopin's first set of Etudes. It was written in 1831 at about the same time as the November Uprising, Poland's failed revolt against Russia. As this etude's alternative title suggests, Chopin seems to have written it as a response to the Polish revolt, and he poured many of the emotions that he was feeling at the time into the work.

The right hand’s motorically complex pattern is turned into an unrelenting storm of agitated torment raging up and down the piano, only kept in check by the march-like left hand’s imperious proclamations.

There have been a great many arrangements, including for strings, harp, wind quintet, orchestra, jazz band, and even a version for bluegrass fiddle. The piece’s distinctive sound comes from its use of plagal cadences instead of dominant cadences and the pentatonic scale, both of which lend a folksy air to the tune. The eponymous girl explores a hill in Scotland, and this is a tactic Debussy uses over and over: painting a musical portrait of a foreign place. | Background: The title La fille aux cheveux de lin was inspired by Leconte de Lisle's poem by the same name, one of his Chansons écossaises (Scottish songs) from his 1852 collection Poèmes antiques (Ancient Poems). Debussy had used the title before, for a song he wrote very early in his career, in 1882, which however doesn't show any particular similarities to the prelude.","Piano sheet music and recordings.

""La clochette"" is relatively little known, and rarely performed. A few years later he produced a second version, removing a lengthy introduction, and changing the key from a minor to A-flat minor, presumably so that the big jumps would land on black keys rather than white ones, making it (slightly) easier to play.

This theme is followed by an imaginative set of variations, likely modeled on Beethoven's approach to this type of work. While the theme is accessible for the intermediate pianist to play, some of the variations do present several challenges that should not be underestimated. After the first two variations, a wistful variation in B flat minor opens the way for a fourth variation in the distant key of G flat major, before Schubert effortlessly modulates back to the home key for the last, light-hearted variation, which gives way for a peaceful codetta as the piece concludes. | Background: The four Impromptus, Op. 90 (D. 899) were probably composed at least in part during the composer's stay in Dornbach in the summer of 1827, just over a year before his death.

The pervading mood is incredibly sad, but there are hints of hope or perhaps happy memories in a ppp-episode in the middle section, and in the very touching shift to C-sharp major at the very end. The technical fireworks are minimized in this piece, but the player needs to have a keen sense of rhythm and pulse. The melodic line incorporates great bunches of notes called “lets.” Duplets, triplets, and quintuplets are three examples, but Chopin even uses a “35-let!” | Background: Chopin dedicated this Nocturne to his sister as a “warmup” to learning his second piano concerto. He borrowed themes from that concerto when composing this piece. The piece is famous for being a life-saver during World War II - it was played by Holocaust survivor Natalia Karp for the Nazi concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth, and it was what Wladyslaw Szpilman played for Wilhelm Hosenfeld to inspire him to save him during Spilman’s isolation in Warsaw.","Classical piano sheet music by Chopin to download: Nocturne Op. posth. in the key of This piece has difficulty level 8 in the category Piece Nocturne Op. posth. in C-sharp Minor, a composition by the early romantic composer Frédéric Chopin who was born in 1810 and died in 1849.

Its melancholic and almost folk-like melody tells its tale in a near improvisatory fashion over a steady, ever-present accompaniment. Through the journey, Chopin explores a few melodic motifs, often decorated with his trusty fioritura figurations, but rarely straying from the character established by the opening theme.

More akin to a Ballade in miniature than a Nocturne, it builds its narrative on three main episodes. Beginning in a mood of profound tragedy, it presents a lonely cantilena, marked mezza voce, over a slow, funereal accompaniment. The second episode features a new theme in C major, built on consoling, chorale-like chords. The chords expand and become arpeggiated, and rising octaves interject with increasing insistence, building to a powerful climax. In the final episode, the opening material returns in a passionate re-exposition, now marked doppio movimento (twice as fast) and underlined by rapidly repeating chords. The piece ends with a diminuendo, finally stopping on three muffled chords, like the tolling of a distant bell. The c minor Nocturne is one of the more technically difficult Nocturnes. The octave passages in the middle section, while not of Lisztian difficulty, are challenging, and the final episode requires a well-developed chord technique with good control over voicing. | Background: The two Nocturnes Op. 48 were written in 1841 and published in 1842.","Nocturne in C Minor Op. 48 No. 1 by Frédéric Chopin.

However, this sonatina has only two movements: fast-faster! The first movement might make you think of a wind ensemble - especially if you know that the composer's father, grandfather and uncle were military oboists, and that he was sometimes called “the Beethoven of the flute” because of his many works for that instrument. It has a wealth of melodic material for the right hand to take care of, often in the shape of rather fast moving eighth-notes. The left hand has many passages with double notes in the middle register, like two horns playing together. The bright and lively second movement is short but comprehensive: its main theme is dance-like and very articulated, but it also contains a more lyrical section, brilliant chromatic scales, and a dramatic coda. | Background: The Op. 55 Sonatinas were published in Copenhagen in 1823. They were designed for teaching purposes and the amateur market, and follow Classical conventions closely in terms of form. This is the first sonata of the set, with a first movement in sonata form and a second movement in sonata-rondo form. | Practice & Performance Tips:: I. Allegro This movement has three sections: an exposition, a development and a recapitulation. It is very important to know where these sections start and end, before you start practicing them. EXPOSITION The exposition starts in measure 1 and ends in measure 20. Write the word ""EXPOSITION"" on the top of m. 1. This exposition, as in many sonatas, has two themes. The first theme is in the tonic. If you group the first three notes together in the first measure (right hand), they form a C-Major chord. Circle all the C-Major arpeggios then play them as a chord (blocked) using the correct fingering. Circle the rests marked on the bass clef. They are as important as the notes in between them and help one give more rhythmic vitality to their playing. The left hand has many passages with double notes in the middle register, whose sound reminds us of two horns playing together. Can you imagine horns when playing the left hand and a violin when playing the right hand? The second theme is in the dominant (G Major). The horns can be heard here too. Practice mm. 10-12 left hand alone. Can you hear the horns alternating with the single note played by your thumb? Check that your thumb is...

The piece has a strict four-bar structure and a very repetitive rhythm, but Mozart creates variety by giving each phrase a different direction. It's quite a feat to make the exact same four bars work convincingly both as an opening and closing statement! One of the characteristics of the classical period is a strong preference for using dissonances and surprise harmonies to add expression to the music. This can be seen clearly even in Mozart’s very first compositions. Listen to the last measure of every four-bar phrase and think about the contribution of the non-chord tones. What if the right hand just played an F already on the first beat of the fourth measure? Perhaps that is what a less gifted composer than Mozart would have come up with. The deceptive cadence to d minor in measure 28, emphasized with a fermata, is another thing that makes this Minuet something more than just a composition exercise. | Background: This Minuet is part of a collection of simple piano pieces that was dedicated to Mozart’s older sister Maria Anna (nicknamed Nannerl), who was also an extremely talented musician. It is dated January 1762, which means that Mozart was 5 years when he composed it. | Practice & Performance Tips:: This piece is in Rounded-Binary Form (the opening material is used again at the end). Before playing this minuet as written, identify the chords outlined by the treble clef notes (m. 1 is F Major, m. 2 is B-flat Major, etc.). Can you play these chords with your right hand and pay attention to the bass line in your left hand? Notice that there are many sequences in this piece. The first three measures have descending sequences while measures 5, 6 and 7 have ascending sequences. How could you show the difference in direction when you perform? Can you analyze what happens after the double bar line? The harmony changes: some chords are not major but diminished, giving a more dramatic feel to the B section. When playing the repeated notes on beats 2 and 3, your wrist should move slightly up and forward. These beats should sound lighter than the downbeat, giving this minuet a bouncy...

Composed quickly, and rehearsed on a mute keyboard as Rachmaninoff crossed the United States, it requires great virtuosity and has the most complex structure of the concertos. Imagine, if you will, being in a concert hall for a piano concerto performance, and then Rachmaninoff and Mahler come onto the stage. One takes his place at the piano, and the other steps onto the podium! Mahler had just a year and a little bit left to live in January 1910. The performance was a rousing success, as had been that of his second piano concerto a decade earlier. This wasn’t the third’s first performance, but it was a special day in the history of music during the first half of the 20th century. Rachmaninoff later described the rehearsal with Mahler: ""He devoted himself to the concerto until the accompaniment, which is rather complicated, had been practiced to perfection, although he had already gone through another long rehearsal. According to Mahler, every detail of the score was important – an attitude too rare amongst conductors. ... Though the rehearsal was scheduled to end at 12:30, we played and played, far beyond this hour, and when Mahler announced that the first movement would be rehearsed again, I expected some protest or scene from the musicians, but I did not notice a single sign of annoyance. The orchestra played the first movement with a keen or perhaps even closer appreciation than the previous time."" Unfortunately, after that special day, the concerto drifted into obscurity until resurrected by Vladimir Horowitz in whom Rachmaninoff had an ardent cheerleader. Rachmaninoff also made several cuts to the score in an attempt to make it more palatable to audiences. None of these cuts worked. Fortunately, Horowitz popularized the uncut version. The piece ends with the four-note rhythm, sometimes interpreted as the composer's musical signature – ""Rach-ma-ni-noff!"" – because it is used in both the composer's Second Concerto and Second Symphony.",Piano Concerto 3 Op. 30 in D Minor (published in 1909) from Concertos by Sergey Rachmaninoff - piano sheet music to download and print instantly.

Motifs and figurations move upward in a kind of hopeful manner, and although the key is A minor, the main theme ends in the relative key C major except at the last repeat. The atmosphere is best captured if the Allegretto marking is adhered to. The middle section offers some, if subtle, contrast to the main mood. The arpeggio in bar 21 offers a welcome moment of typical chopinesque embellishment, and the grace notes in this section can be performed more brilliantly than those in the outer sections. | Background: This Waltz was composed near the end of the Chopin’s life, perhaps even as late as 1849, the year he died. It was unearthed in the 1950s, together with another previously unknown waltz in E flat major (no 18) by the American pianist Byron Janis, at Chateau Thoiry near Paris, France. A few years later he repeated his discovery at the Yale University, where he found two other unknown versions of the same Waltzes! | Practice & Performance Tips:: As in any piece by Chopin, focus on a cantabile playing and make use of the tempo rubato. Many of Chopin's waltzes are in an ABA form - they have 3 sections, which many times are punctuated by repeat signs. Find these sections and add capital letters (A) and (B) at the beginning of each section. Then use the directions listed below to practice each section. 1 – Practice the left hand only first. a) Play the downbeats only (bass notes) going from one measure to another. Note the pattern outlined by this bass line and memorize it, speaking the note names as you play. b) Likewise, play the second beat only (chords) going from one measure to the next. Note the pattern outlined by these chords and note the voice leading. Can you play the chords lightly, with firm fingers and a supple wrist? 2 – Practice the right hand only. Following the phrasing correctly gives continuity to your playing. Note the slurs - Chopin was very specific with markings - and make sure that the notes under these slurs are played legato.

It's been said that he was inspired to compose it when watching a dog chase its tail.",Waltzes,D-flat Major,1847,7,Early Romantic,"Dog dance..?: It's been said that Chopin was inspired to write this waltz when he was watching a dog chase its tail, and it has a kind of playful, frantic quality as well as many swirling passages that would suggest something along those lines. The passagework fits the hand very well, and many pianists will find that the right-hand notes are much easier to play than it sounds, even to the point where it can be hard for the left to follow with the necessary lightness and transparence. Apart from being a very effective show piece, this is in many ways an ideal exercise in the control of fast passagework and flowing waltz accompaniment. | Background: The Waltz in D-flat major, Op. 64 No. 1, is commonly known as ""The Minute Waltz,"" with an emphasis on the second syllable. The implication is therefore that this is a ""small"" waltz, not a waltz intended to be played in a minute as many people believe.

A keen sense of style, as well as good handling of scales, broken chords and double notes is required. Obviously Mozart took care to maintain the highest standards also when writing for students. Evenness of passage work and smoothness of accompanying patterns play a major role in the first movement. This innocently graceful Andante shows a surprising depth of emotion, despite its apparent simplicity. Here the right-hand focus is on cantabile, while the left hand is a veritable Alberti-bass exercise. The final Rondo, with its playful imitating staccato thirds, is the most lively and child-like of the three movements. | Background: The Sonata in C major K 545 is sometimes referred to as ""Sonata facile""or ""Sonata semplice"" – which both mean the Easy Sonata. Indeed, Mozart referred to it in his work catalogue (June 26, 1788) as ""a little Piano Sonata for beginners"". The manuscript of this charming and delicate work is sadly lost, and it was not published during the composer's lifetime; the first edition appeared in 1805. Supposedly, Mozart intended the piece to be used for teaching, but we don't know anything else about the circumstances of its composition. | Practice & Performance Tips:: A very important element of the first movement are the scales and broken chords, moving constantly up and down the keyboard. Strive to shape these &quot;wave patterns&quot; musically. The suble shading of dynamics and timing that is needed to phrase this kind of music beautifully needs a loose and flexible wrist and arm. Unless this is achieved, the fingers will only be capable of a mechanical, note-by-note rendition. The second movement provides an excellent opportunity to practice your Alberti bass patterns. Just make sure that they don't take over; see to it that the right hand dominates without having to use force. In this case, it is advisable to use finger pedal in the left hand – that is, holding on to notes (bass notes in particular) rather than releasing them when the next one is struck. (Although Mozart listed this work as ""for beginners"", this is not exactly what you should expect a first year piano student to take on. Not even the slow second movement is particularly easy, unless you have some previous experience of the piano writing of the classical era. A good and clear articulation of scales, broken chords and double notes is needed, as well as good execution of left hand Alberti bass patterns. But don't let this scare you...

Particularly the first-movement variations on a beautiful Siciliano theme bring Mozart’s full inventiveness to bear.,Sonatas,A Major,1783,8,Classical,"Three great Mozart movements: One of Mozart’s most famous sonatas, if not the most famous, is the Sonata No. 11 in A Major K. 331 featuring the popular Turkish March , or Rondo alla turca, as its final movement. Instantly recognizable and delightfully catchy, it alternates sections in minor with a rousing march theme in major. Two other movements complement the Rondo alla turca; a second movement in the form of a stately minuet and a first movement in variation form. Particularly the first movement brings Mozart’s full inventiveness to bear, employing many of his favorite variation devices to transform the opening siciliano theme: a jocular first variation in faster note values, triplet arpeggios, a contrasting variation in minor, crossing hands, a dignified Adagio variation, and a sprightly finale in a faster tempo. A favorite among late intermediate students and above, the sonata has brought joy to generations of listeners and pianists alike. | Background: The Sonata No. 11 in A major K. 331 was composed in 1783 and published in 1784 alongside the Sonata No. 10 in C major K. 330 and the Sonata No. 12 in F major K. 332.

It features many of the hallmarks of Chopin's style - an undulating accompaniment figure of widespread broken chords, a beautiful melody extensively ornamented with fioritura figurations and other creative inspirations, creative harmonic progressions, and a certain underlying bittersweetness even though the piece's key is in the major. Similarly to its sibling Nocturne, the melody is occasionally joined by an additional voice, forming a passionate duet, the poetic significance of which is up to the pianist to decipher. | Background: The Nocturnes of Op. 27 were written in 1836 and published in 1837. They mark the transition to Chopin publishing Nocturnes in pairs instead of three Nocturnes per opus.

Its solemn, mournful beauty and lack of significant technical challenges make it highly accessible both to listeners and students from the early intermediate level and above – though, as with all the Preludes, there is plenty to explore with regards to tone color, chord voicing and phrasing for the pianist wishing to create a truly masterful rendition. | Background: Chopin's set of 24 preludes was first published in 1839 and dedicated to the composer Joseph Christoph Kessler. Some of them were composed in Mallorca during his disastrous visit there with his lover, George Sand. They initially received quite some criticism for their brief length and lack of any traditional structure; they were seen as more like sketches or brief notes as opposed to fully-formed ideas. However, there were also some, more forward-looking contemporaries, among them Robert Schumann, who admired them intensely. Today, they are widely admired for their compositional economy, poetic beauty, and imaginative use of the piano’s resources, and are often performed as the complete set, though Chopin himself only played a maximum of four of the preludes at any single public performance.","Piano sheet music and recordings.

It’s a charming little meditation, that doesn't contain any of the pyrotechnics that some of his later works did; but there are some mild hints that point to Debussy’s later style in terms of harmony. The dreams the performer experiences while playing the piece get lusher and more expansive throughout the piece – although without ever arriving at a real climax (a fact that contributes to the dreamlike atmosphere) – until the quiet ending where the slumbering person doing the dreaming turns over and goes back to sleep. | Background: Debussy didn’t regard Rêverie as an important work – in fact rather the opposite. At the time, Debussy complained in a letter to a friend that “the various lessons I rely on for my daily bread have gone off to the seaside, without a thought for my domestic economy"". He composed Rêverie and had it published in the hope of getting some economic relief. When another publishing firm (Fromont) reprinted it much later, he wrote: “I regret very much your decision to publish Rêverie. I wrote it in a hurry years ago, purely for material considerations.

Chopin himself used the piece in his teaching and admonished his pupils to play the first measures in a manner that evoked the image of a mortuary. The mysterious opening motif, so short and quiet that it's almost inaudible, is followed by a very loud, majestic statement. This exchange happens numerous times before we get to the vibrant flowing melody that is repeated with variation throughout the piece. In the B section, things become quieter and more contemplative. It is almost as if the original ""questioning"" voice were returning to speak at a greater length, which it does with increasing confidence, making more and more emphatic statements before leading back to the return of the opening section and on to the magnificent coda. This is indeed a fascinating piece, demanding brilliance, lyricism as well as a keen sense of dramatic structure. | Background: In the mid-1830s Chopin arrived at a new, mature style exemplified by the the concentrated drama of the second Scherzo and the deep-felt lyricism of the Nocturnes, Op. 27. The B-flat minor Scherzo was hailed as a masterpiece, outshining even the first Scherzo in B minor, which had already been ever-present on concert platforms.

https://www.pianostreet.com/chopin-sheet-music/ballades/ballade-1-op-23-g-minor.htm,Frédéric Chopin,"Ballade 1 in G Minor, Op. 23",From the very first notes in the first Ballade there’s a feeling that Chopin means to tell us something extraordinary – a tale that grows slowly until we reach the powerful and ecstatic coda.,Ballades,G Minor,1835,8+,Early Romantic,"Chopin's romantic vision: With the publication of this work, Chopin introduced the term ""ballad"" into piano music. He was possibly inspired by his compatriot, the poet Mickiewicz, who gave his own definition of the literary ballad: ‘a tale spun from the incidents of everyday (that is, real) life or from chivalrous stories, animated by the strangeness of the Romantic world, sung in a melancholy tone, in a serious style, simple and natural in its expressions’. No doubt, Chopin had a similar vision of this highly Romantic genre. This is pure romanticism, a music that speaks with great urgency, spontaneity, and even violence. | Background: The origins of the first Ballade are shrouded in mystery. All we know is that it had been written by 1833 and was published three years later. A tradition links the work with Chopin’s sojourn in Vienna around 1830, which seems probable because it has little in common with the ‘brilliant’ style to which Chopin returned during his early Paris years. The first Ballade has always been one of Chopin’s most popular works. Not only was it featured in the 2002 film “The Pianist,” but it was also a favorite of many figure skaters who skated to medals performing to it. Interestingly, the publisher of the Guardian newspaper, Alan Rusbridger, himself an amateur pianist, strove to learn the piece in a year. It took him 16 months, and he wrote a book about it called “Play it Again: An Amateur Against the Impossible.”","Frédéric Chopin: Ballade 1 Op. 23 in G Minor from Ballades - piano sheet music to print instantly.

https://www.pianostreet.com/chopin-sheet-music/polonaises/polonaise-op-53-a-flat-major.htm,Frédéric Chopin,"Polonaise 6 (Heroic Polonaise) in A-flat Major, Op. 53","Often considered the supreme example of how Chopin's works evoke the resilience of the Polish spirit, this celebrated warhorse of the Romantic piano repertoire has earned the nickname ""Heroic Polonaise"".",Polonaises,A-flat Major,1843,8+,Early Romantic,"A vision of Polish glory: The first theme of this most epic of Chopin's Polonaises, following a brief introduction that sets the majestic tone of the piece, feels very aristocratic and triumphant. It is later contrasted with a fanfare-like theme in E major, introduced by fortissimo arpeggiated chords. This second theme is first heard softly, as if from afar, then twice grows into mighty climaxes, the second of which leads back to the noble first theme. The second theme is accompanied by a bass ostinato of descending octaves in the left hand. These continuous left hand octaves, which easily stiffen the arm if not played with a proper technique, are perhaps what most pianists consider the most technically difficult feature of this piece. However, it might be helpful to remember the fact that, according to Chopin’s friend Charles Hallé, the composer always “felt very unhappy when he heard the grande polonaise in A flat major played fast, as it spoilt the whole grandeur and majesty of that noble inspiration."" | Background: This polonaise—a Polish court dance in three-four time— was probably begun in 1842 and published the following year. It's often considered as the supreme example of Chopin evoking the resilience of the Polish spirit. During the German invasion of Poland at the outset of World War II, Polish Radio broadcast this piece daily as a patriotic protest.","Classical piano sheet music by Chopin to download: Polonaise Op. 53 in the key of This piece has difficulty level 8+ in the category Piece Polonaise Op. 53 in A-flat Major, a composition by the early romantic composer Frédéric Chopin who was born in 1810 and died in 1849.

The first, Ondine , portrays a water nymph singing to seduce a mortal man to visit her kingdom at the bottom of a lake. The soft, shimmering music emerges out of nothing, and goes on to capture the swirling flow and glittering splashes of water. ...When she had breathed her song, she begged me – begged me – to put her ring on my finger; to be her husband and sink with her down – down to her drowned palace and be king of all the lakes. I told her I loved a mortal woman. Abashed and vexed, she dissolved into tears and laughter; vanished in a scatter of rain… | Background: Gaspard of the Night — Fantasies in the Manner of Rembrandt and Callot is a book by Aloysius Bertrand, considered one of the first examples of modern prose poetry, which had a profound influence on many later French poets and artists. Some of Bertrand's grotesque and nightmarish poems very much appealed to Ravel, who set his impressions of three of the poems to music. The resulting suite is considered to be one of the most difficult pieces in the pianist’s repertoire – Ravel deliberately set out to make the final movement more difficult than Balakirev’s Islamey.","Maurice Ravel: Ondine No. 1 in C-sharp Major from Gaspard de la nuit - piano sheet music to print instantly.

Both outer movements are in ritornello style, alternating recurring sections meant to imitate orchestral tutti with “solo” sections. The forte and piano markings, unusual for Bach, help guide the player by highlighting melodies and recurrences of the tutti themes. | Background: Bach published his “Concerto in the Italian Style”, now known as the Italian Concerto, in 1735.

In Liszt’s version, the vocal part appears as a tenor, singing tenderly in the middle register of the piano, enveloped by veiled chordal accompaniment in both the higher and lower registers, creating a sort of three-handed effect. Halfway through the piece, arpeggio figurations replace the chords, but they are not of the flashy kind but delicate, peaceful. Glittering quietly in the high registers of the piano like stars in the night sky, they only temporarily gain in intensity during the piece’s emotional climax. While not strictly a virtuoso piece, the multilayered textures and arpeggio figurations can nevertheless be challenging to manage, demanding a highly refined technique and musicianship on the part of the pianist. | Background: “Ellens dritter Gesang” was composed by Franz Schubert in 1825 and published in 1826 as a part of a song cycle (Op. 52) featuring seven songs from Walter Scott's The Lady of the Lake. Liszt’s transcription closely follows the structure of the original composition. It was composed in 1837-1838 and published in a collection titled “12 Lieder von Franz Schubert” (later revised in 1876), featuring a variety of Schubert’s songs in transcriptions by Liszt.",Liszt: Schubert: Ave Maria in B-flat Major (published in 1838) .

The piece follows a simple A-B-A scheme to great effect, the drama being suddenly born out of the fading reverie of the opening section, pitting dark cascades of sound against moments of more light and hope. The opening section finally returns with only tiny modifications to conclude the piece. Technique-wise this Nocturne is more challenging than the other Nocturnes in the opus, as well as those of Op. 9 which preceded it. The middle section's right-hand double note pattern in particular demands a highly refined technique to play in tempo. | Background: The three Nocturnes Op. 15 were written between 1830 and 1833 and published in 1834, when Chopin was in his early twenties.

At the time of writing Jeux d'eau, Ravel was a student of Gabriel Fauré, to whom this piece is dedicated. The work is in a single movement, typically lasting between four and a half and six minutes in performance. Jeux d'eau has a claim to being the first example of impressionism in piano music. The piece is known for its virtuosic, fluid, and highly evocative nature, and is considered one of Ravel's most important works for piano. The piece is characterized by its fast, shimmering, and cascading piano figurations, which are meant to evoke the sound of flowing water.

No. 2, especially, is famous, but No. 1 is almost as well-known. It gently rocks listeners as if they were in an old-fashioned wooden crib. Chopin juxtaposes uneven collections of notes against the nearly rigid evenness of the eighth notes in the left hand. The second section takes us into a strange other world: an almost ascetic melody without ornaments, repeating the same phrases over and over again. This takes up a full two-thirds of the piece; by contrast, the two “A sections” are pretty tiny. This is another piece of Chopin’s in the minor that resolves into a major – ""Picardy"" – third at the end (like for instance the ""Revolutionary Etude"", and the Nocturne No. 20 in C-sharp minor). | Background: This Nocturne is the first in a set of three written between 1830 and 1832, when Chopin was about twenty years old.","Frédéric Chopin: Nocturne Op. 9 No. 1 in B-flat Minor from Nocturnes - piano sheet music to print instantly.

In each A section, the somber main theme is presented twice, first as a lone melody followed by a short episode, and then again reinforced in octaves. A transitional episode modulates to B major and the first entry of the B section, which provides some consolation before leading back to an exquisitely decorated variation of the A section. A short transition brings about a slightly modified repeat of the B section, now in E major, bringing the piece to a quiet close on the Picardy third. This Nocturne can be a rewarding piece to study for the early advanced or determined intermediate student if its main technical obstacles – supple navigation around the keyboard with the left hand and a couple of fast scales and arpeggio runs in the right hand – can be overcome. Apart from the opportunity it provides to study these difficulties along with melodic cantabile playing, there are few listeners whose hearts will remain untouched by a convincing performance of the piece. | Background: Though Chopin asked for his unpublished pieces to be destroyed after his death, they were rescued from this fate by his friends and family. Julian Fontana, Chopin’s long-time confidant, published this Nocturne among a number of other unpublished works during the 1850:s. Though Fontana deemed the Nocturne to be a work from 1827 - Chopin’s late teens - this has more recently been disputed due to the level of compositional craft and emotional maturity it exhibits.","DOWNLOAD: Frédéric Chopin - Nocturne (opus posth) Op. 72 No. 1 in E Minor ( from Nocturnes by Chopin).

In many ways, it seems to be a struggle between two opposing forces - darkness and light. In its creeping, almost morbid outer sections, a pleading melody sings like a frail, lonely bird over the blackness of the left hand's unusually widespread arpeggios. Open fifths and subtle dissonances in the left hand reinforce the atmosphere, with only the slightest hint of a ray of hope occasionally shining through, even as a counter-melody joins in, turning the main theme into a sorrowful duet. It is not until the middle section that catharsis arrives in the form of an anxious, vehement crescendo exploding with astonishing power into a huge, triumphant climax, which is followed by a moment of sunshine. However, despair soon overtakes joy, leading back to the opening material. Only in the coda does light finally extinguish the darkness, the melodies of the duet lovingly cradling each other into the ending on a Picardy third. | Background: The Nocturnes of Op. 27 were written in 1836 and published in 1837. They mark the transition to Chopin publishing Nocturnes in pairs instead of three Nocturnes per opus.

One might view it as a tender dedication from Schumann to his daughter. As the title suggests, the main interest of the piece is in the right hand cantabile and phrasing. But it's also worth noting the Alberti-like acompaniment pattern. Apparently, this was an technique Schumann considered essential for young pianists to master - the same kind of texture reappears several times in the beginning of the set (no. 3, Humming Song, and no. 5, Short Piece) | Background: Schumann started composing “Album for the Young” as a birthday album for his eldest daughter Marie. The project grew and ended up as a printed collection of 43 pieces, together with a section of ""Advice to young musicians"" and a ""Short Music History Course"". His wife Clara remarked: ""The works that the children usually learn in their piano lessons are so bad that Robert lit upon the idea of composing and publishing a book (a kind of album) containing small pieces for children. He has already written a number of charming little pieces."" Many of the pieces have remained very popular teaching pieces, such as this Melody in C major. | Practice & Performance Tips:: Although the left-hand line is written in quavers, make sure that your thumb plays the notes that fall on the off beats softly. In fact, a good practice technique here is to play only the notes that fall on the beats (therefore, you would play mm. 1-2 as follows: C-F-E-C-F-G-E-E). After you memorize this bottom line, try to play the duet, adding your right hand. Try to analyze it. Do the lines move in parallel motion? Or do they move in contrary motion? Schumann used one dynamic marking only – piano. However, your sound has to really project with a singing tone when performing this lovely piece. Follow the line contour by growing when the notes go higher and getting softer when the notes come down. Schumann added an interesting marking over the downbeats for the right hand in mm. 5, 6 and 7. Those notes should be played expressively. Make sure that you stress each one a bit more, as if you were climbing a ladder. Could you sing the lines separately? You will find points in which you will need to breathe. Mark those points on the score and do breathe as you play this nice...

https://www.pianostreet.com/rameau-sheet-music/harpsichord-pieces/minuet-c-1-c-major.htm,Jean Philippe Rameau,Minuet in C in C Major No. 1 from Harpsichord Pieces,"This happy Minuet with its catchy, meandering tune is a popular teaching piece and a fine technical workout for the right hand.",Harpsichord Pieces,C Major,1724,2,Baroque,"Rameau’s five finger exercise: This simple Minuet has only two single voices: a beautiful melody in meandering eighth-notes, accompanied by elegantly striding quarter- and half-notes in the left. It serves to illustrate a point which Rameau liked to emphasize when explaining his views on keyboard fingering and hand movement: no large movement should be made where a smaller one will suffice. The melody of this Minuet contains no larger intervals than a third within each phrase, and it is possible to play the whole piece with very little sideways movement of the right hand if you use all five fingers. Making such a big deal of a five finger exercise may seem quite unnecessary to modern pianists, but the fact is that until the 18th century, keyboard players avoided the use of the thumb which was regarded as too insensitive. Besides, in itself, this is lovely piece well worth the effort - which is not so great anyway: it can be mastered and memorized quickly at an early stage of learning. | Background: The first edition of Rameau's second set of harpsichord pieces contained a short essay on fingering: ""La Méchanique des doigts sur le Clavessin"". While the essay disappeared in the following reprints, the Minuet which served as an example of Rameau's fingering principles continued to occupy a place in the collection and has remained a popular teaching piece. | Practice & Performance Tips:: When playing music from this period, it is important to imagine a harpsichord, whose sound did not last very long. Therefore, play long notes (quarter notes in the left hand) shorter and detached. The non-legato touch will help give a dance-like feel to this minuet. Many harpsichords normally had two keyboards. The top keyboard played more softly than the bottom keyboard. Harpsichord players would move their hands from one keyboard to another whenever they wanted to vary the sound with contrasting dynamics (forte or piano). At the piano, you do not have to move to another keyboard, but a good pianist does vary the sound immediately when there is a change of dynamics. This minuet has many melodic sequences. Can you find them? For example, measure 2 is a copy of measure 1, but one step lower. The same pattern is used after the double bar line, but in G Major. Compare the A and B sections, both hands. The only difference is that the B section is transposed to G Major (a very useful tip to help you memorize this piece more quickly!). Be very faithful to the dynamic changes. Although repetitive, this piece can sound very interesting and colorful if you follow the suggested dynamic...

Both moods are accompanied by the same obsessively repeated note, like stubborn raindrops indifferent to human emotion.",Preludes,D-flat Major,1834,7,Early Romantic,"A beautiful dream: Here is a miraculous example of Chopin’s amazing virtuosity in translating human emotions to piano music. Within the rather short piece - even if it is the longest of the preludes - Chopin manages to build up two entirely different atmospheres, using the same obsessively repeated note. The C-sharp minor section begins rather suddenly in measure 28, and with it the piece changes from something peaceful and serene into something much darker. Listeners and music historians have likened it to a beautiful dream that turns into an oppressive nightmare. The feeling of uneasiness present in the middle part is made even stronger by the serene calm and beauty of the first 27 measures. The first theme is reintroduced towards the end of the prelude, giving it a peaceful ending. The repeating A-flat (written as G-sharp in the middle, ominous section) never stops throughout the piece. Interpreters of this piece need to be able to sustain the long melodic lines, balance the different levels of sound, and convey the two contrasting moods convincingly. | Background: In her memoirs, George Sand related how one evening she and her son Maurice, returning home in a terrible rainstorm, found a distraught Chopin who told them about a dream he had while sitting at the piano: ""He saw himself drowned in a lake. Heavy drops of icy water fell in a regular rhythm on his breast, and when I made him listen to the sound of the drops of water indeed falling in rhythm on the roof, he denied having heard it. He was even angry that I should interpret this in terms of imitative sounds. He protested with all his might – and he was right to – against the childishness of such aural imitations. His genius was filled with the mysterious sounds of nature, but transformed into sublime equivalents in musical thought, and not through slavish imitation of the actual external sounds."" Sand did not specify which piece Chopin had played on that occasion, but it has been assumed to be the D-flat major prelude.","DOWNLOAD: Frédéric Chopin - Prelude (Raindrop) Op. 28 No. 15 in D-flat Major ( from Preludes by Chopin).

Giving in, only for a moment, to an outburst of despair, it transitions into its final section, featuring what seems to be a chorale, perhaps illustrating a small organ playing in a chapel somewhere, alluding to the Nocturne's original title ""At the cemetery"". Composed a day after Chopin attended a performance of Hamlet, he later erased this title, saying: ""Let them figure it out for themselves."" | Background: The three Nocturnes Op. 15 were written between 1830 and 1833 and published in 1834, when Chopin was in his early twenties.

Employing many of his favorite pianistic devices, Liszt expands upon the original melody, finally reaching a rapturous climax with arpeggios cascading and ecstatic chords singing in unabashed triumph. Though highly virtuosic, the piece is much more than a mere showpiece, the technical fireworks serving to capture and enlarge the heartfelt passion of the original song. | Background: The original ""Widmung"" is part of Robert Schumann's song cycle Myrthen, Op 25, which he worked on in secret for months and finally offered as a wedding present ""to his dear bride"" Clara Wieck in 1840. Set to a text by German poet Friedrich Rückert, it captures the elated feelings Schumann must have felt when he was finally able to marry his beloved Clara after many painful years of opposition from her father. Liszt’s arrangement of the song was published in late 1848 under the title ""Liebeslied"" but was written possibly as early as 1846/1847. It is a prime example of Liszt’s penchant for promoting the music of colleagues he admired through creating arrangements and transcriptions, thus presenting it to a wider audience. Unfortunately, however, it seems Robert was possibly not too enamored with the arrangement, stating at one point: ""[..] I am no fan of song transcriptions – and I really detest those by Liszt.""",Liszt: Schumann: Widmung in A-flat Major (published in 1848) .

Liszt removed the final recapitulation of the first subject in the 1851 version of the piece, along with an extended bravura passage preceding it. The piece starts with a furious quick main theme, left hand playing the melody in octaves and the right hand playing the same melody one octave higher alternatively, quickly followed with chords. The furious main theme flows into the playful melody of the secondary subject. When actually played at the original speed that Liszt indicated (""Presto furioso"", or fast and furious; at around minutes), the piece quickly becomes formidable.

This transcription offers an opportunity to work on a singing legato and expressive phrasing in a Baroque context.,,D Minor,1700,1,Baroque,"Can you sound like a violin?: This Sarabande sounds solemnly tragic because of its minor mode and slow tempo. It is also filled with expressive ""sighs"", two-note slurs expressing tension and release. The right hand cantabile and phrasing is obviously very important here, but the left hand also has many interesting and original features - e.g. the long, emphasized notes on the second beat, typical of the Sarabande style. A pianist would do well to study a good violin performance when playing a piece like this. Pianists can learn a lot if they study the way violinists shape a melody, and then try to strive for the same singing tone on their own instrument, connecting every note with the next as much as possible. A violinist with sense of style would also add ornaments to this piece. Baroque composers expected performers to embellish simply written, slow pieces like this. A good example of what can be done can be found here. | Background: Violinist and composer Arcangelo Corelli (1653-1713) wrote many beautiful sonatas for violin and harpsichord. This is one of the movements from the Sonata in D Minor, Op. 5, No. 7, transcribed for the piano. | Practice & Performance Tips:: This piece sounds very dramatic because of its key (D minor) and tempo (Largo). Try to imagine the warm sound of a violin when playing the right hand. The two-note slurs should be played legato with an emphasis on the first note. When trying to memorize this movement: - Study the relation between the right and left hands. Ask yourself if the lines are in parallel or contrary motion in each measure. You may want to write arrows in between the staff to detect the direction of the notes more easily. - Note that the left-hand notes in mm. 5-8 form a descending line from D to A. - Note that the motive in mm. 9-10 is repeated as a sequence a step down in mm. 11-12. The most dramatic passage in this piece is mm. 13-14 because of the chromaticism (an E-flat is added in m. 13) and the tritone G-C-sharp in the right hand. A tritone was considered “scary” or “evil” in the Baroque period. When you play these measures, make them sound like the climax for the entire...

Consequently, this is certainly no show-piece, but an extremely serious work, alternately ominous and tender. Originally, it was composed as a sonata for two pianos.

Such endeavors are certainly worthy, and the pianist will be well rewarded with a nostalgic and yearning experience that calms the soul and lifts the spirit. | Background: The Klavierstücke Op.118 were written in 1893 during the composer's yearly summer sojourn at Bad Ischl. Like his other late outpourings of short pieces for the piano (op. 116, 117, and 119), they were written mainly for Clara Schumann, who was still a formidable pianist in her 70s at the time.

Its enduring and endearing popularity are a testament to its charming quality. The descending gestures of the introductory piano solo are angular and dramatic after the opening timpani roll. The brilliance and virtuosity on display in the Concerto can seem far removed from Grieg's more subtle, lyrical creations for solo piano; but there is common ground, such as the distinct elements of Norwegian folk music. The first notes from the piano were inspired by Schumann’s piano concerto from a decade earlier. Indeed, the two works share much in common: key, length, stylistic choices, and overall mood. | Background: It is interesting to note that, despite the fact that the work was an instant megahit, Grieg himself was curiously unsatisfied with the work. He tinkered with it constantly from 1868 until his death in 1907. In all, he made more than 300 changes to the score after the premiere. Grieg was in his 20s when he composed it, and it became his only concerto. He had also not yet composed an orchestral work up until that time, and the concerto is a sterling effort for a “first try.”","DOWNLOAD Piano Concerto in A Minor Op. 16 by Edvard Grieg.

A distinct feature is the two melodic lines which gently embrace in tender counterpoint and explore different registers of the piano throughout the piece. Like most of its siblings, this waltz is a very short work, lasting only around a minute, and in binary form; the repeat of the first part appears as a variation, while the second part is repeated verbatim, with no return of the opening theme. | Background: The 16 Waltzes Op. 39 were composed in 1865 and published in 1866 in three different versions – one for four hands, and two for piano solo, with one difficult and one simplified version.

It is calm and lyrical, and features an unusual and mysterious recurring trill in the low register. The second movement has a sad theme with a very special accompaniment figure covering a large part of the keyboard. The Scherzo is comparatively short and lightens the mood considerably. The last movement is again quite enigmatic and ambiguous, starting with a strong octave on G coming out of nowhere, and then alternating between a peaceful, easy going dance, singing melodies and shocking chordal eruptions. | Background: This sonata is the last thing that Schubert composed for solo piano. He finished it in the fall of 1828, probably either the month he died or the previous month. Neither this nor the other two last sonatas were published until ten years after Schubert's death, and continued to be neglected during most of the 19th century.

The piece was published in 1881 and is included in Liszt's Miscellaneous pieces .",Nuages gris,,"used in this piece.]] Nuages gris (; French, lit. Grey Clouds), S.199 or Trübe Wolken, is a work for piano solo composed by Franz Liszt on August 24, 1881. It is one of Liszt's most experimental works, representing, according to Allen Forte, ""a high point in the experimental idiom with respect to expressive compositional procedure."" Departing from his earlier virtuoso style, Liszt in his later years made several radical, compositional experiments, including Nuages gris, Unstern S.208 and Bagatelle sans tonalité S.216. Yet it was only in the second half of the twentieth century that the significance of Liszt's late experimental works began to be appreciated. R. Larry Todd, for example, has noted that ""Arguably, Liszt was the first composer to establish the augmented triad as a truly independent sonority, to consider its implications for modern dissonance treatment, and to ponder its meaning for the future course of tonality. Liszt's accomplishments in these areas were considerable and support in no small way his position, in Busoni's phrase, as the 'master of freedom.'"" Scholars such as Humphrey Searle, Zoltán Harsányi, Bence Szabolcsi, Lajos Bárdos, and István Szelényi have contributed much to placing these works in the repertoire of today's pianists. Nuages gris is quite short and technically simple. According to Jim Samson, ""the most distinctive features of Liszt's late style are present in this short work—the avoidance of a conventional cadential structure, the importance of semitonal movement, the use of the augmented triad as the central harmonic unit and of parallelism as a principal means of progression."" The harmonies are based on augmented triads while the melody line makes extensive reference to the Hungarian minor scale. The harmonies, which are very different from those found in his earlier works, give a very dark and almost morbid feel to the piece. Leonard Ratner has commented: ""The restless, unresolved dissonances of Nuages gris the isolated figures, the sense of alienation—these have a clear affinity with the somewhat later expressionism of the Viennese composers Mahler and Schoenberg.... [Nuages gris] is a musical bellwether that indicated what was happening and what would happen in European music: sound, with the assistance of symmetry, would take over, harmony would be absorbed into color and lose its cadential function."" Claude Debussy probably had Nuages gris in mind when he composed his own Nuages. Mauricio Kagel used Nuages gris in his Unguis incarnatus est (1972). in 1986, Heinz Holliger worked the piece out into Zwei Liszt-Transkriptionen for orchestra (together with Unstern!). A shocking scene at the morgue in Stanley Kubrick's last film Eyes Wide Shut is accompanied by Nuages gris.",,,,,,,,

Stravinsky, who had, by that time, emigrated to France after his studies with Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in Russia, was confronted with American jazz combos actively influential in Europe. Stravinsky's knowledge of stylistic jazz properties was at first limited to scores brought to him from the United States by his colleague Ernest Ansermet. However, he had managed to hear live jazz bands by the time he finished Piano-Rag Music. Compositionally, Stravinsky interprets the ragtime in a rather cubist way, instead of directly imitating the style. Stravinsky incorporates elements from his Russian period (ostinati, shifting accents, bitonality) with rhythmic and harmonic fragments from ragtime. The irregular meters give the piece an improvisatory character. Stravinsky wrote the piece for Arthur Rubinstein, but it was instead premiered by José Iturbi, on November 8, 1919 in Lausanne.",,,,,,,,

Le Gibet conjures up the image of a corpse suspended from a gallows in the light of the setting sun, while a bell is tolling in the distance. Ravel´s bell is the B-flat octave that sounds continuously throughout the piece. What is it – this uneasy sound in the dusk? Is it the screech of the north wind, or does the hanged man on the gallows let out a sigh? Is it a cricket who sings lurking in the moss and ivy which covers the forest floor out of pity?... It is the bell ringing by the walls of a city below the horizon and the carcass of a hanged man reddened by the setting sun. | Background: Gaspard of the Night — Fantasies in the Manner of Rembrandt and Callot is a book by Aloysius Bertrand, considered one of the first examples of modern prose poetry, which had a profound influence on many later French poets and artists. Some of Bertrand's grotesque and nightmarish poems very much appealed to Ravel, who set his impressions of three of the poems to music. The resulting suite is considered to be one of the most difficult pieces in the pianist’s repertoire – Ravel deliberately set out to make the final movement more difficult than Balakirev’s Islamey.",Ravel: Le Gibet No. 2 in E-flat Minor (published in 1908) .

It was completed on 4 June 1841. A typical performance lasts about eleven minutes. The work was written as part of a campaign to raise funds for the erection of a large bronze statue of Ludwig van Beethoven in his home town of Bonn. The publisher Pietro Mechetti asked Mendelssohn to contribute to a 'Beethoven Album', published in January 1842, which also included pieces by Liszt, Chopin, Moscheles and others, of which the proceeds would go to the Monument. (Schumann's Fantasie in C was the final result of a work originally intended for the same purpose). Mendelssohn is known to have written three sets of piano variations, but only this one was published during his lifetime. The autograph manuscript of the set is preserved in the Jagiellonian Library. Many of the variations require a virtuoso technique. Mendelssohn's good friend Ignaz Moscheles stated ""I play the Variations sérieuses again and again, each time I enjoy the beauty again."" Ferruccio Busoni also liked the work very much.

Using a simple opening theme and repeating harmonic progression as a basis, the listener is invited into a sprawling set of variations resembling more a baring of the soul than the dance form the Chaconne originated from. Creating a whole world of deep thought and powerful emotion, Bach’s richness of invention and command over structure is on display in full force throughout the piece. Busoni’s transcription is mostly faithful to the original violin part, adding color through octave doublings, transposition, and occasional countermelodies, reflecting his thought that “Bach goes far beyond the boundaries and means of the violin in his conception of the work, so that the instrument he has intended for use in performance does not suffice”. Being an outstanding pianist himself, Busoni’s transcription reflects a thorough knowledge of the technical capabilities of the piano, and while difficult, the arrangements remain highly pianistic throughout. | Background: Busoni admired Bach from a young age and created piano transcriptions of several of Bach’s works. The original Chaconne in d minor BWV 1004 is the final movement of Bach’s Second Partita for solo violin. Busoni’s transcription of the Chaconne was first published in 1892; he subsequently revised the work multiple times until the version known today was published in 1916, in Volume 3 of the “Bach-Busoni Complete Edition”, where several other transcriptions also featured.","Piano sheet music downloads and recordings.

Interestingly, the lyrical line is visually stretched through Schubert’s ingenious use of a rare ""double all breve"" or 4/2 time signature, with the half-note receiving a beat and four such beats in each measure. If the piece were written in 4/4 time, the rolling arpeggios would be double-barred 16th notes, and the page would look crowded and tense rather than relaxed and languid. The middle section becomes more agitated with sharply accented bass notes as the composer’s mind wanders afield before returning to the lovely meadows of G-Flat Major. | Background: The four Impromptus, Op. 90 (D. 899) were probably composed at least in part during the composer's stay in Dornbach in the summer of 1827, just over a year before his death. The first two went to press in late 1827; it wasn't until 1857 that Nos. 3 and 4 appeared in print.

It begins with subdued, nimble-fingered figurations cascading downwards, being responded to by murmuring chordal passages. Straying in an unusual manner from the piece's home key, it starts in A flat minor, traversing through C flat major to B minor before deftly modulating to its true tonal center of A flat major, where the cascades turn ever more joyful, even jubilant. A dark middle section in C sharp minor follows, where a wistful melody sings over chordal accompaniment. Eventually, this section transitions back into the subdued opening section, followed by a final return of the joyous A flat major section, concluding the piece firmly in its home key. | Background: The four Impromptus, Op. 90 (D. 899) were probably composed at least in part during the composer's stay in Dornbach in the summer of 1827, just over a year before his death.

In the main theme, a left hand consisting of a continuously sighing motif in chords underlines a wistfully descending melodic line in the right hand. Though the melody seems to seek occasional consolation in the relative major, it keeps getting overtaken by sorrow until the chorale-like middle section in E flat major offers a moment of comfort. Being built on a simple chordal melody, this section reveals a kinship with the Nocturne in G minor Op. 15 no. 3, which ends with a similar idea. In this Nocturne, however, the opening section makes a full return after the respite of the middle section, and only at the very end does sorrow turn into acceptance, in the form of a Picardy third. | Background: The Nocturnes Op. 37 were written in 1839 during the time of Chopin's stay in Mallorca with his lover, author George Sand.

Its barcarolle-like, flexibly undulating nature, and its time of composition coinciding with Chopin's stay in Mallorca with George Sand makes one wonder if it isn't a quiet trip by boat during a warm night that is evoked. The main sections feature some of Chopin's most unusual harmonic progressions, modulating, for example, from G major into the distant key of e flat minor within the space of three measures, and then further on into a minor in about the same amount of time. The music theory enthusiast will be most interested in the transition from the main sections into the second theme, which makes clever use of mediants and chromaticism in one of Chopin's most daring modulations. Despite its overall quiet nature, this is one of Chopin’s more technically challenging Nocturnes, the double note patterns requiring a refined technique if they are to be played with the smoothness and security that is needed. | Background: The Nocturnes Op. 37 were written in 1839 during the time of Chopin's stay in Mallorca with his lover, author George Sand.

It follows the A-B-A formal structure Chopin often employed for his Nocturnes, with a dramatic middle section surrounded by calmer outer sections. In this case, though, there are no vast outbursts of torment, just an increasingly agitated atmosphere as the middle section traverses through f minor to f sharp minor and back to A flat major and the passionate return of the main theme. Interestingly, the Nocturne begins and ends with the same two-bar chordal passage, as if the pianist is opening and closing a book. Perhaps we have just listened to a tender memory of a past love? | Background: The Nocturnes of Op. 32 were written and published in 1837.

The melodic line wanders languorously through the higher registers, repeating almost obsessively, as if unable to stop dwelling on the sorrow and regret which generates its movements. Below this, the left hand anxiously repeats a pattern of an eighth note triplet followed by a quarter note, its pulsations driving the melody and harmony forward. The middle section contrasts strongly with the sadness of the outer sections, changing its meter from 4/4 to 3/4 and modulating to D flat major, its main motif consisting of two chords followed by a melodic flourish. Curiously, Chopin said that this section was like a recitativo that should be played as if ""a tyrant commands, and the other asks for mercy.” Compared to the first Nocturne of Op. 48, which has many technical difficulties, this Nocturne is quite accessible to the late intermediate student. | Background: The two Nocturnes Op. 48 were written in 1841 and published in 1842.",Nocturne Op. 48 No. 2 in F-sharp Minor (published in 1842) from Nocturnes by Frédéric Chopin - piano sheet music to download and print instantly.

Eschewing, for the most part, the lone melodic line over a rolling accompaniment typical of the genre, it supports its main theme with a web of counterpoint from the outset. The mood remains intimate throughout, the narrative weaving in and out of a gentle calm and softspoken melancholia, save for one outburst – a d sharp minor scale running up and down the length of the piano’s upper register, a cry of despair quelled as suddenly as it appears. When the contrasting middle section arrives, the music remains gentle, changing only to a single voice over a syncopated accompaniment and via a slight modification of emotional character. The return of the opening theme is famed for how it is embellished with figurations and multiple-bar-long trills and has been likened to an Italian da capo aria in the bel canto style, a genre Chopin is known to have loved. | Background: The Nocturnes Op. 62 were the final Nocturnes to be published in Chopin’s lifetime.

Beginning on a lone B flat followed by a trill, “a cry out in the night” according to pianist Alfred Cortot, the winding left-hand figurations join in to underline a narrative that is more like an improvisation than a formally bound piece. Lacking the contrasting middle section he often employed for his Nocturnes, but suffused with a bittersweetness only Chopin could summon, its themes morph in and out of each other, increasingly decorated and joined by mysterious counter melodies. The coda dissolves into a glittering haze, ending on a few simple chords, sighing dreamily. | Background: The Nocturnes Op. 55 were composed between 1842 and 1844 and published in 1844.

Arriving again and again at a cadential section marked stretto followed by a rest with a fermata, the piece repeatedly seems on the verge of blossoming into something grander, only to stop in its tracks and return to its previous character. In one of Chopin's most original endings to any of his Nocturnes, the coda comes as a rude awakening, introducing a severe recitativo interjected by heavy chords, ending the piece on what might be called the opposite of a Picardy third - in b minor instead of the home key of B major.

Its title - “Barcarolle” - refers to the traditional folk song sung by Venetian gondoliers, which was typically in 6/8 and a moderate tempo and rhythm, matching the gondolier’s oar stroke; though Tchaikovsky’s piece is in 4/4, it has a similar, steady rhythm. The middle of the piece features a faster and happier section in G major building to an energetic theme marked “Allegro giocoso” and a dramatic climax of arpeggiated diminished chords which leads back to a repeat of the opening material. An atmospheric Coda concludes the piece. | Background: Tchaikovsky composed 12 pieces featured in “The Seasons” at the request of the publisher of a monthly music magazine, “Novelliste”. The composer was to provide an appropriate piece for each of the 12 issues of the magazine. The resulting work became immensely popular and was later published in its entirety together with the great G major sonata, Op. 37.

The basis of the form is a dance with trio, but here Chopin enriched the simple ternary form in a unique way: each of the themes is followed by a ""ritornello"" of whirling eighth notes. In the trio, the mood and timbre changes through an enharmonic change to D-flat major. The key of C#-Minor seems to have a mysterious ring to it, which is why composers before and after Chopin have used it to convey “unknowables.” Beethoven, for example, used it in the Moonlight Sonata to convey subdued melancholy. | Background: The three Waltzes in Op. 64 were composed in 1847, only two years before Chopin’s death.

A tender melody is embedded within bell-like octaves. Brahms added two lines of text that said, “Sleep well, my little child. It pains me greatly to see you weep.” The poetry fits the music perfectly: the first stanza in German – Schlaf sanft mein Kind, schlaf sanft und schön! – corresponds exactly to the first two bars of music, while the second stanza (about the weeping) matches the middle section, which descends into dark, murky depths, using the parallel key of E-flat Minor. | Background: Composed in 1892 at Bad Ischl, together with the Seven Fantasies Op. 116 the three Intermezzi for solo piano, Op. 117 are among the final works of Johannes Brahms.

The piece is charming and simple, lacking the fiery pyrotechnics of the other etudes. It is somewhat similar in scope, style and atmosphere to the second movement of Beethoven’s Pathétique Sonata. Others have called the piece ""Tristesse"", but rather than just “sadness” it seems to express a kind of warm nostalgia and love for the homeland. | Background: Chopin famously said about this etude, nicknamed Tristesse : “In all my life I have never again been able to find such a beautiful melody.” When he played the piece for a student once, he reportedly burst into tears and cried ""Oh, my homeland!""

It stands as a great example of Chopin’s skill at taking a technical difficulty – in this case, rapid notes in both cramped and widespread patterns – and turning it into an emotionally satisfying tone poem that far transcends the role of a mere exercise. Like most of Chopin’s Etudes it is in ternary, or A-B-A form, rounded off with a great climax marked FFF and a thunderous Coda bringing the piece to a breathtaking close. | Background: Chopin's first set of etudes signifies a complete overhaul of the etude genre, transforming it from technical drudgery to a true art form with rich emotional and musical content, which at the same time takes piano technique to new heights.

Nevertheless, the piece remains characteristically Rachmaninoffian throughout, with bell-like sonorities and a grand, distinctly Russian climax appearing during the middle of the piece. Though challenging, the piece is approachable for amateur pianists of some skill. A powerful interpretation makes full use of the dynamic contrasts between the piece’s different sections as well as between the right and left hand, as indicated by the composer. | Background: The légie is the first of the five pieces of the Morceaux de fantaisie Op. 3, which also includes the famous Prelude in C sharp minor Op. 3 no. 2.

Featuring highly inventive and often virtuosic keyboard writing, modulations to unusually distant keys, and sometimes an audacious use of dissonance, they exhaust the technical and tonal possibilities of the harpsichord, and they have become popular among harpsichordists and pianists alike.","DOWNLOAD: Domenico Scarlatti - Sonata K. 466 in F Minor ( from Sonatas by Scarlatti).

XVII: 6","With its depth of emotion, and experimental use of the newer piano's sustained tone, this masterwork of Haydn's maturity seems to look forward to the Romantic era.",Variations,F Minor,1793,8,Classical,"Romantic, emotional Haydn: This work is contemporary with the last piano sonata, but it’s not the same in either scope or key. Haydn’s F-Minor variations actually has one theme in F minor (A) and one in F major (B), followed by alternating A and B variations, which is called double variation form. The double variation is strongly associated with Haydn, who wrote many such movements during his career. The sections in minor are melancholy or even somber and carry most of the expressive weight of the piece, while the major sections are more brilliant. The long coda takes the piece in very unexpected directions. The harmony of these variations is cutting-edge for the time. It’s not quirky in the same way as other Haydn pieces from the same period are. Instead, it’s full of dissonances that seem tame by modern standards but that were likely jarring in 1793. | Background: The F minor variations might have been inspired by the death of Haydn's very good friend Maria Anna von Genzinger. She was a skilled amateur pianist and singer whose correspondence with Haydn provides a very personal view of the composer. The musical elite of Vienna used to assemble and perform at the Genzingers' home, and Haydn loved to attend these gatherings whenever he was in Vienna. He also wrote his piano sonata in E flat, Hob.

Carried by an irresistible mix of glittering virtuosity and dramatic push and pull, it combines Tchaikovsky’s gift for passionate lyricism with virtuosic caprice to delightful effect. The first movement’s famed introduction is instantly recognizable, its opening horn melody quickly transitioning into a memorable and passionate theme in D flat major supported by chords crashing across the full extent of the keyboard. Rich with interplay between the orchestra and the piano, the movement brims with passion and glittering virtuosity, occasionally catching its breath in more intimate and lyrical moments. The second movement is in D flat major and A-B-A form. The outer sections are serene, almost pastoral, and, similar to the first movement, feature continuous interplay between the orchestra and the piano. The middle section is marked Prestissimo and flits and twirls with spritelike caprice, creating a contrast in tempo and character without detracting from the overall impression of a captured moment of contented happiness. The final movement is in rondo form and is decisively energetic and upbeat despite the minor key, thanks to numerous syncopations and middle-of-the-bar accents. Like the previous movements, capricious virtuosity contrasted with lyrical secondary themes interplay throughout. A virtuosic cadenza in octaves leads into the piano and orchestra coming together in a final passionate outburst, creating a glorious ending to a glittering and exciting concerto. | Background: Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1, Op. 23 was composed between November 1875 and February 1875 and revised in 1879 and 1888. Though its premiere in October 1875 was resoundingly well-received by the audience, the critical response was lukewarm. It has since become one of the most well-known piano concertos in the repertoire as well as one of Tchaikovsky’s most popular compositions.","Piano Concerto 1 in B-flat Minor Op. 23 by Peter Ilyitch Tchaikovsky.

(Richard Jones)",Concertos,D Minor,1738,8+,Baroque,"Concerto of Elemental Power: Before the concerto adopted the sonata-allegro form for its first movement in the late 18th century, there was ritornello form. There were two groups of musicians and their instruments. The larger group was the ritornello group, and the smaller group was called the camerata group. “Ritornello” means “the group that returns” while “camerata” means the “chamber group.” Many of Bach’s concertos fell into this form, and the D-Minor keyboard concerto is one of them. Unlike many of Bach’s other works, this concerto isn’t remarkably contrapuntal but looks forward to his sons’ innovations and the slightly later world of Haydn. The concerto is as popular for piano as it is for harpsichord here in the 21st century. The work borrows from the earlier Toccata and Fugue in D-Minor as the concerto has many sections that contain the kind of technical wizardry that is the hallmark of the toccata form.","Baroque piano sheet music by Johann Sebastian Bach to download and print instantly: Concerto in D Minor BWV 1052 in the key of .

The first movement makes use of dramatic contrasts between major and minor and between lyricism and elegant passagework. The lyrical second movement is short and peaceful, and the final movement is a good-natured rondo, featuring a middle section in minor which provides contrast before the return of the opening material. | Background: The three Sonatinas Op. 20 were published in 1820 and were probably composed for amateur musicians or as teaching aids. They are often studied by intermediate pianists, serving alongside the sonatinas of Clementi’s Op. 36 as a stepping stone towards more advanced works in the Classical style.","Classical piano sheet music by Friedrich Kuhlau to download and print instantly: Sonatina Op. 20 No. 1 in the key of .

Consisting of eleven pieces, among them the melodic gavotte, the two-part Bourrée, and the Gigue in sonata form, the collection presents many technical challenges such as the use of overlapping octaves, doubling in thirds and sixths, and pedaling. It was once described by Kosenko as a 'family album' with each piece dedicated to a member of his family such as his nephew Fedir, to whom Rigaudon was dedicated, and his wife Anna who was the dedicatée of the eighteen-minute long Passacaglia.

It has everything that a piano sonata should have, but in a smaller scale, making it accessible to less experienced pianists.",Sonatinas,C Major,1797,3,Classical,"Your ticket to the world of piano sonatas: This sonatina by Clementi is an excellent opportunity to get acquainted with classical sonata form. The Op. 36 sonatinas are numbered in order of increasing difficulty, which means that this one has the most basic “lessons” on classical piano technique. The pianist gets a chance to practice the chords and scales of c major in an easy format, but in a real context of musical artistry. The first movement can be described according to classical sonata form, and has a first theme based on the C major triad plus a descending C major scale, and a second theme in the dominant G major, with more scales and passage work for the right hand. The second part develops the the theme in the minor mode. Finally, the themes are both recapitulated in C major with some interesting variations. The second movement has a beautiful cantabile melody in F major, with elements of double note playing, and with a broken chord accompaniment. The transition into the final movement is almost seemless but still very contrasting - the broken chords of the left hand continue at more or less the same tempo, but the time signature changes from 3/4 Andante to 3/8 Vivace, and the new material in the right hand is very rhythmical and playful. This movement also has some brilliant, swirling passagework requiring strong, agile fingers, and a loud Coda. | Background: Muzio Clementi wrote over a hundred Sonatas and Sonatinas, of which the opus 36 set, first published in 1797, was by far the most successful - Op. 36 No. 1 especially is known worldwide to virtually every pianist who has advanced to an intermediate level. Around 1815 Clementi issued a Fifth Edition in which several details (notes, dynamics, tempos, articulations etc) were altered. Many passages were transposed up one octave to exploit the greater range of the evolving piano. However, most current editions are still based on the musical text of the first edition. | Practice & Performance Tips:: I. Allegro This movement has three sections: an exposition, a development and a recapitulation. It is very important to know where these sections start and end, before you start practicing them. EXPOSITION The exposition starts in measure 1 and ends in measure 15. Write the word ""EXPOSITION"" on the top of m. 1. This exposition, as in many sonatas, has two themes. The first theme is in the tonic. If you group the notes together in the first measure, they form a C-Major chord. Notice that the notes in this first theme form descending lines. Circle all the C-Major arpeggios then play them as a chord (blocked) using the correct fingering. Notice that the notes in m. 6 form a C-Major chord but it is inverted! Circle the rests marked on the bass clef. They are as important as the notes in between them and help one give more rhythmic vitality to their playing. Play the left hand lightly. This bass line should support the melody without overshadowing it. The second theme is in the dominant (G Major). Make sure that you play the G Major scale in m. 8 and m. 10 with the correct fingering. Notice that the notes in this second theme form ascending lines. When playing these lines, be...

He attempted to compose one no fewer than three times before completing the Op. 54 in the key of A-Minor. His previous attempts were in D-Minor, F-Major, and Eb-Major. It is among the most-performed of any of the Romantic piano concertos. Early listeners were struck by the extent to which the piano and the orchestra interacted, pursuing their unified symphonic intent, as opposed to the more standard opposing and turn-taking in standard virtuoso concertos of the day. As with many of Schumann’s works, the composer inserts Eusebius and Florestan into the fabric of the piece. In this case, it is the “duelling woodwinds” in the first movement. | Background: Clara was instrumental, pardon the pun, in helping Schumann realize his piano concerto. She had seen the aborted earlier attempts and urged him to take his single-movement Fantasie for Piano and Orchestra, which was not selling, and expand it into the concerto. He finished it and was so grateful to his loving wife that she gave the premiere performance even though the work was dedicated to Ferdinand Hiller, who conducted.","Downloadable piano sheet music by Robert Schumann to print: Piano Concerto Op. 54 in A Minor Piano Concerto Op. 54 in A Minor, a composition by the early romantic composer Robert Schumann.

Technically approachable enough for the late intermediate student to enjoy, it nevertheless demands mastery to keep the narrative together while finding all the colors and subtle inflections hidden within the music. After the almost hypnotically repetitive introductory section, a simple triplet accompaniment takes us on an initially peaceful journey. Increasing tension soon leads to some highly emotional eruptions, finally receding into a quieter ending section, balancing precariously on the edge between C minor and C major. Only at the very end does peace win the battle, ending the Impromptu on a C major chord. | Background: The four Impromptus, Op. 90 (D. 899) were probably composed at least in part during the composer's stay in Dornbach in the summer of 1827, just over a year before his death.

The piece can be seen either as a Rondo, or as a Sonata movement without the development section. The dramatic main theme, which makes use of the Neopolitan sixth (a typical hallmark of Beethoven's ""Appassionata"" sonata, also in the key of f minor), transitions via octaves and chordal passages into the relative major, A flat, and a peaceful second theme with a flowing sixteenth accompaniment. The main theme is repeated, followed by a similar transition to the flowing second theme, this time in F major. This peace is not allowed to remain undisturbed, however, and a final repeat of the main theme ends the piece on a dark note. | Background: The four Impromptus, Op. 90 (D. 899) were probably composed at least in part during the composer's stay in Dornbach in the summer of 1827, just over a year before his death.

It was written in February 1916, published in 1918, and debuted by the composer on April 21, 1919, in Budapest. The Suite is one of Bartók's most significant works for piano, only comparable with his 1926 Piano Sonata. Though much of Bartók's work makes frequent use of Eastern European folk music, this suite is one of the few pieces without melodies of folk origin. (At times incorrect: The majority of Bartok’s major works do not use actual folk melodies) However, Romanian, Arabic, and North African rhythmic influences can still be found in some movements. Originally intending the suite to be a five-movement work, Bartók later decided against the idea and discarded the second movement, the Andante, which was published only posthumously in the October 1955 issue of Új Zenei Szemle (New Musical Review). The 1918 version, without the Andante, takes between 8 and 9 minutes to perform and is played in four movements:",,,,,,,,

In many ways, it seems to be Chopin’s swan song, holding a world of meditative reflection, melancholy, agitation, and ultimately acceptance, perhaps of what must have seemed an inevitable fate to Chopin, whose progressing illness had become serious at this stage. Marked Lento, it begins with its melody meditating over a simple accompaniment, exploring its inner world with a longer thought here, a shorter inflection there, supported by increasingly creative harmonic progressions. A second theme over a rolling accompaniment in sixteenths is introduced, leading to the feverish middle section in c sharp minor, featuring the right and left hand in agitated dialogue through tightly woven counterpoint. When the initial theme returns, it is far from a verbatim repeat of the opening section but rather a continuing reflection with new progressions of both melody and harmony, leading to a return of the second theme, which brings the piece to its close. A last stanza ends the piece in absolute calm, in final, peaceful acceptance of both what has been, and what is to come. | Background: The Nocturnes Op. 62 were the final Nocturnes to be published in Chopin’s lifetime. They were written between 1845 and 1846 and published in 1846, three years before his death.","Classical piano sheet music by Chopin to download: Nocturne Op. 62 No. 2 in the key of This piece has difficulty level 8 in the category Piece Nocturne Op. 62 No. 2 in E Major, a composition by the early romantic composer Frédéric Chopin who was born in 1810 and died in 1849.

The presto section showcases Mendelssohn’s elf-like qualities. It is very similar both to the music of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” and the last movement of the Violin Concerto in E-Minor. One can almost hear the sylphs and fairies flitting through the trees. The presto is also more complex than the composer’s “Songs Without Words” and requires a much more advanced technique. | Background: A first version of the Rondo Capriccioso was composed in 1828. It featured only the sparkling bravura part, and was simply called an ""Etude"". Two years later Mendelssohn reworked it for the young piano virtuoso Delphine von Schauroth, whom he was courting, adding the introductory adagio and making the second part even more brilliant.",Rondo Capriccioso Op. 14 in E Major (published in 1824) by Felix Mendelssohn - piano sheet music to download and print instantly.

The work consists of two linked sections: a lyrical Andante in E major and a virtuosic Presto in E minor. Mendelssohn originally composed the Presto as a standalone étude in 1828. In 1830, while in Munich, he revised the work for the pianist Delphine von Schauroth, adding the slow introduction to create the form it is known in today. The revised piece was published in 1831 by Pietro Mechetti. The Rondo capriccioso is thematically integrated, with the opening melody of the Andante forming the basis for the main theme of the Presto. Its structure, combining a slow introduction with a fast finale, was influenced by the works of Carl Maria von Weber and served as a model for some of Mendelssohn's later compositions for piano and orchestra. Mendelssohn frequently performed the piece himself, and it quickly became a popular virtuoso showpiece in the piano repertoire.",Felix Mendelssohn,E major – E minor,Op. 14,,,,,

The left hand chords need to be played crisply and decisively and the dynamic and articulation markings (slurs, staccato, accents) followed carefully to achieve full effect. In the B section, the finger-work is taken over by the left hand. Short and unassuming as it is, this etude even features a dramatic ""grand finale"". | Background: This piece belongs to Friedrich Burgmüller's set of 25 Easy and Progressive Studies, one of the most widely used educational works in the repertoire. | Practice & Performance Tips:: This is an interesting study on five-finger patterns. Strive for an even touch and make sure that the last note of each slur has a slight wrist lift. This lift may help play the second beat more lightly, giving more charm to this study. The tempo marking Allegro scherzando means ""lively and jokingly"". The word ""leggiero"" means light. Do not force the sound, but play from your knuckles. Analyze the harmony (left hand) for the A section and try to memorize its chord progression. Play each chord with a quick release for a crisp sound. The B section has the five-finger pattern on the left hand now. Strive for a steady pulse without slowing down. Again, make sure you play the last note of each slur with a quick release/lift. This might become easier if you think of the first note in each downbeat as part of a line. Therefore, your bass line outlined in mm. 11-16 is G-sharp, A, G-sharp, A, C-sharp, D.

Grieg tells the performer to play with passion, which at first seems to belie the bucolic nature of this little piece.

Grieg himself called these efforts “an intimate life story”, and they are considered a prime example of the inventiveness and slight wryness that made his keyboard music so enchanting.

The andante section is introverted and lovely while the stormy second movement brings a storm to the fore. The crescendos and decrescendos have been described both as crashing waves and ebbing and rising winds. The sonata stays true to Scriabin’s combination of 19th-century Romanticism and 20th-century impressionism to create one of the most popular of his works. The first part evokes the calm of a night by the seashore in the South; in the development we hear the sombre agitation of the depths. The section in E major represents the tender moonlight which comes after the first dark of the night. The second movement, presto, shows the stormy agitation of the vast expanse of ocean. | Background: Scriabin first experienced the sea on a trip to Latvia in 1892, and started to work on the second sonata soon after. Four years later, after Scriabin had performed the sonata several times, he told his publisher: “I have admittedly finished the sonata, yet I am completely dissatisfied with it, even though it has been revised seven times.” He wasn't able to finish it properly before his marriage to the pianist Vera Isacova in 1897, with whom he went on honeymoon to the Black Sea.","DOWNLOAD Sonata 2 in G-sharp Minor Op. 19 by Alexander Scriabin (published in 1897) .

Inhabitants of Breton have told the story for generations upon generations. It’s sort of the Northern French version of Atlantis, the sea devouring the island and all who inhabited it, save for the king and his daughter. Thinking she is opening the gates of the city to let in her secret lover, she instead opens the dikes and floods the place. The legend is that, at low tide, onlookers can see the spires and hear the carillon beneath the waves. Debussy evokes this combination of charming and macabre scenes with a collection of harmonic techniques and haunting themes. Debussy goes further than the legend, musically yanking the cathedral out of the water in a radiant C-Major section. Performers sometimes jump up and down to bring their full weight upon the keys to create the biggest sound possible to convey the grand scale of the organ in the cathedral. Once the cathedral has had its moment in the sun, Debussy brings in the tide and buries it again in the ocean.

It was first published in 1843, after the composer's death, by Carl August Klemm in Leipzig, in a publication known as Fünf Klavierstücke (Five Piano Pieces). In the first edition of the Deutsch catalogue all five pieces were grouped under the same number 459. Whether it is a single composition in 5 movements is a matter of contention. From the second edition of the Deutsch catalogue the three last pieces of the set were split off as D 459A, Drei Klavierstücke (Three Piano Pieces), with only the two first movements regarded as belonging to the same sonata, D 459. In his introduction to the first edition of the five pieces, Klemm refers to them as compositions, not movements of the same composition. In the extant autograph of the first piece, Allegro moderato, Schubert however wrote Sonate on top of the page, and continues in the same manuscript with an incomplete version of the second piece, the first Scherzo. It is not known whether Klemm possessed another (completer) manuscript of this Scherzo, or is responsible for its completion in its published form. No other combinations of the pieces are known from extant autographs or contemporary copies. Apart from the first two pieces, only a fragment of the fifth piece, predating the first printed version, is extant. D 506 has been suggested as a third and final movement of a sonata put together with the third D 459A piece (Allegro patetico) as first and the Adagio D 349 as second movement. Andrea Lindmayr-Brandl follows Klemm in his assertion that he compiled the pieces for his 1843 publication from a number of different Schubert compositions. Lindmayer concludes that the work is ""fragmentary"", because Schubert had broken off the sonata at the close of the development section of the second movement.",,,,,,,,

This first sonata in particular marks a significant step toward the composer’s mature piano sonata style; the format and several characteristic stylistic elements continue through the last.",,,,,,,,

The title, which translates as “Reverie” or “Daydream” is of course very characteristic for a romantic piece of music. Schumann reportedly regarded the titles of Kinderszenen “nothing more than delicate hints for execution and interpretation”, but one has to say that it would be hard to find a better word to describe the innocent, gentle, soothing character and the calm repetitiveness of this music. No real worries enter the mind of the daydreaming child in Träumerei, although Schumann adds a tiny bit of uneasiness to the middle part of the piece, using some mild dissonances and modulations into minor keys. | Background: In 1838 Schumann told his future wife Clara that he had composed ""thirty small, droll things"", inspired by her comment that he sometimes seemed ""like a child"". Thirteen of these were to be published in the final version of Kinderszenen. In this collection, Schumann presents us with a peaceful and idyllic view of childhood.

The sudden explosion of the Piú mosso, with its rumbling bass passages and plaintively responding chords, raises the emotional temperature, and a new theme of tormented despair builds to a great climax. As the music dies down, the opening theme returns and is soon woven into accelerating triplets, bringing the listener towards a final, wistful melodic sigh in the left hand, underlining arpeggios caressing up and down the piano. After a scintillating, accelerating figuration ascends to the highest registers, a final sequence of chords ends the piece on the Picardy third, perhaps reminiscing of a far-gone, happier time. | Background: The Nocturnes Op. 55 were composed between 1842 and 1844 and published in 1844.

The occasionally-used alternate title, “Appassionata”, was not given or authorized by Liszt, but instead provided by Ferruccio Busoni, in an early edition. Passage work for the left hand is rather difficult, while the right hand plays the melody mostly in octaves. Other difficulties include cramped spacing (the hands are often close together), left-hand arpeggiated passage work, complex figurations in polyrhythm, and the right hand ascending the keyboard in swiftness using only the thumb, the third, and fourth finger. The étude is in sonata form, with a second group in E minor, and an explosive coda. The climax occurs right after the softest part of the piece and is an octave D played 23 times in a row with rhythmic changes and rapid left-hand arpeggios that constantly change theme. The 1837 version bears a coda which is modelled after the coda in the finale of Beethoven's ""Appassionata"" Sonata. Moscow native and classical pianist, Evgeny Kissin, launched into the limelight in 1994 in Los Angeles performing his interpretation of Transcendental Étude No. 10 at Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. Kissin has continued to perform interpretations of Liszt's work throughout his career. Diocesan College alumni, Liam Pitcher, won the Rustenberg Piano Festival in 2011 performing Transcendental Étude No. 10.

DOWNLOAD piano sheet music from Piano Street digital sheet music library. Handel: Sarabande and Chaconne in G Minor S. 181 by the composer Franz Liszt (1811-1886). This piano piece was composed in 1879 and is part of Liszt's Transcriptions of other composers' works .,Sarabande and Chaconne from Handel's Almira (Liszt),Liszt,"Franz Liszt composed his transcription of the Sarabande and Chaconne from Handel's opera Almira for piano solo (S.181) in 1879 for his English piano student Walter Bache to play at a Handel festival in England. The Almira transcription is noted by critics as one of the most striking of Liszt's late concert arrangements as well as his only setting of a baroque piece from his late period. Liszt's decision to set Handel was probably due at least in part to please British audiences, for whom Handel was still the preeminent national composer and before whom Bache would likely appear. Nevertheless, the choice of subject matter was surprising, not only by being Handel instead of Bach but also from being taken from a Handel opera which was virtually ignored at the time. In his most recent baroque transcription prior to Almira, that of Bach's Fantasie and Fugue in G minor, BWV 542 dating from 1867, Liszt follows the original almost exactly. With Almira, Liszt deviates considerably. The result of Liszt's work is a highly unified double-set of variations — one set of variations on the sarabande followed by a separate set on the chaconne — nearly becoming an independent work in the process. (Humphrey Searle in fact catalogued the work as an independent composition.) The sarabande dominates the piece, functioning much like a Bach chaconne as variations on a harmonic progression, while the chaconne itself is of the balletic variety, having nothing to do with the repeated bass lines of the work. This work is said by some to anticipate Ferruccio Busoni's late-romantic settings of Bach in its overall grandeur, especially in the major key transformation of the sarabande at the work's conclusion.",,,,,,,,

The A section of Brahms’ Albumblatt presents the four bar pastoral motive which is the main material of the piece. The writing of both hands is dominated by parallel thirds, which gives this section a somewhat orchestral character. In the B section the texture becomes more transparent; the parallel thirds disappear and the left hand supports the theme with chords and a single voice in inverted motion. The four bar structure is also finally broken up from bar 19, where the latter, sighing part of the motive takes over and gives rise to a series of modulations back to the key of A minor. A very Brahmsian six bar transition leads to the return of the A section, this time marked poco a poco accelerando e crescendo. From bar 39, the first half of the main motive is stubbornly repeated, and the diminished chords over a pedal point on A increase the tension and drama up to bar 47. Here we feel a sense of release at the appearance of the sub-dominant, after which a four bar cadenza ends the piece rather abruptly.","Classical piano sheet music by Brahms to download: Albumblatt in the key of This piece has difficulty level 6 in the category Piece Albumblatt in A Minor, a composition by the early romantic composer Johannes Brahms who was born in 1833 and died in 1897.

It was dedicated to Her Royal Highness Princess Anna of Hesse. As with most piano quintets composed after Robert Schumann's Piano Quintet (1842), it is written for piano and string quartet (two violins, viola and cello). The work, ""often called the crown of his chamber music,"" began life as a string quintet (completed in 1862 and scored for two violins, viola, and two cellos). Brahms transcribed the quintet into a sonata for two pianos (in which form Brahms and Carl Tausig performed it) before giving it its final form. Brahms destroyed the original version for string quintet, but published the Sonata as Op.&nbsp;34b. As a piano quintet, it was given its premiere in Paris some two weeks before Good Friday in 1868. The outer movements are more adventurous than usual in terms of harmony and are unsettling in effect. The introduction to the finale, with its rising figure in semitones, is especially remarkable. Piano and strings play an equally important role throughout this work, which Swafford notes for its ""unity of expression"" and a consistently dark mood: ""at times anguished, at times (in the scherzo) demonic, at times tragic.""",,,,,,,,

Translating roughly as Morning Song of the Jester , this piece combines the flavour of Andalusian folk music with pianistic acrobatics such as double glissandi and extremely fast repeated notes. These may look simple on the page, but making sure each 16th-note triplet is heard is the mark of a true virtuoso (and the sign of a well-functioning piano action). The four-measure fragment marked “Plus lent” is jarring in its charming simplicity after such cheeky agitation. Ravel alternates the slow and dreamy fragments with sections that grow more agitated until the original mood returns. Equally quirky is the close, dissonant harmony, which stretches even Ravel’s usual splashes of color. | Background: The piece was dedicated to Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi, a Greek-French music critic whom Ravel had met while studying at the Paris Conservatoire.

Among 20th century pianists, György Cziffra notably attained enormous audience success with this piece. The galop features various technical difficulties, one of the most significant being the sixteenth-note jumps played by the right hand in bars 85 through 92, 157 through 164, and 173 through 180. Similar to the jumps studied in Liszt's étude ""La campanella"" but typically played far more rapidly, these jumps reach intervals of thirteen steps (two and a half octaves) at their largest. Other technical difficulties include rapid chromatic scales played by the third, fourth, and fifth fingers, and sixteenth-note jumps in the left hand.",,,,,,,,

Compared to its two sisters, which are accessible to the intermediate pianist, this Nocturne is more difficult to play. Fioritura figurations in the right hand and rapid accompaniment in the left hand during the middle section all ask for a good command over the fingers and suppleness of the pianist's hand and wrist. | Background: This Nocturne is the last in a set of three written between 1830 and 1832, when Chopin was about twenty years old.","Nocturne in B Major Op. 9 No. 3 by Frédéric Chopin.

As thanks, he received the beautifully written manuscript of this piece.",,A-flat Major,1917,6,Impressionism,"Debussy's last piano piece: This wonderfully atmospheric piece is very much in the style of Debussy's Preludes. Written on three staves, with thick chords in both hands, its dynamics remain within the range of ppp to p, placing high demands on exactness of touch, voicing and colour. Prompted by the composer's gratitude to his coal merchant during the harsh winter of 1916-17, it also reveals links back to Debussy's early years, and his lasting admiration for the poet Charles Baudelaire. The title is a line from Baudelaire’s poem ‘Le Balcon’, set by Debussy along with ‘Harmonie du soir’ in his Cinq poèmes de Charles Baudelaire (1888). From this latter poem Debussy had extracted the line ‘Les sons et les parfums tournent dans l’air du soir’ (‘Sounds and scents swirl through the evening air’) as the title of the fourth piece in his first book of Préludes, and he quotes the opening of this prelude at the start of Les soirs illuminés. | Background: Les soirs illuminés par l’ardeur du charbon (Evenings Lighted by the Glow of Coals) is Debussy’s very last work for piano, discovered as late as in 2001.

Intermediate pianists can play many of these gems, and this undoubtedly contributed to their ultimate popularity. There are 48 songs that are grouped into eight codices. Mendelssohn intended the songs to remain without lyrics even though many of his friends tried unsuccessfully to add words to the compositions. Even Liszt was inspired by these pieces, and he honored Mendelssohn with his “Großes Konzertstück über Mendelssohns Lieder Ohne Worte,” or “Grand Concert Piece on Mendelssohn’s Songs Without Words.” The latter is for two pianos, and of course, Liszt gives Mendelssohn a pianistic workout in his own inimitable style.",Spring Song Op. 62 No. 6 in A Major (published in 1844) from Songs Without Words by Felix Mendelssohn - piano sheet music to download and print instantly.

It harks to the quirkiness of the later London Symphonies, some of which were contemporary with this sonata, such as No. 99. The off-balance phrasing and cheeky harmony is here on the piano keyboard in addition to being there on the symphonic score as well. The highly unusual switch to E major – a key very distant to E flat – makes the introspective start of the second movement sound like the entrance into another world. | Background: Haydn wrote the work for Therese Jansen, a brilliant pianist whom he met in in London when visiting there in the 1790s.

Liszt treats the dance form itself much less freely than he did much earlier with the verbunkos in the Hungarian Rhapsodies, and the material itself remains more specifically Hungarian than gypsy in thematic material. Their spare lines, angular rhythms and advanced harmonies show these pieces to be direct ancestors of the compositions of Béla Bartók. Because of these attributes, the csárdás are considered by Liszt scholars among the more interesting of the composer's late output. One potential pitfall in discussing these works is labeling them as atonal on the basis of hearing strange sonorities at the surface of the music. The Csárdás macabre, for instance, is solidly based on compositional procedures consistent with Liszt's earlier style. The music focuses on variant forms of the mediant with concomitant contrast of sharp and flat key areas—in this case F major, F-sharp minor and G-flat major.",,,,,,,,

The following program note, which Liszt took from Lenau, appears in the printed score of the Mephisto Waltz No. 1: There is a wedding feast in progress in the village inn, with music, dancing, carousing. Mephistopheles and Faust pass by, and Mephistopheles induces Faust to enter and take part in the festivities. Mephistopheles snatches the fiddle from the hands of a lethargic fiddler and draws from it indescribably seductive and intoxicating strains. The amorous Faust whirls about with a full-blooded village beauty in a wild dance; they waltz in mad abandon out of the room, into the open, away into the woods. The sounds of the fiddle grow softer and softer, and the nightingale warbles his love-laden song. The first recording of this piece was by France Clidat in her traversal of Liszt's works for Decca.",,,,,,,,

It is well suited to be played in a lively but not too fast tempo, and rewards diligent students with a dizzying display of charming counterpoint to delight both themselves and their audiences. If the eighth notes are played staccato and the sixteenths legato in typical Baroque fashion, the piece provides an excellent opportunity to practice playing different articulations with each hand. The piece can be thought of as having three parts. The first part lasts through bars 1-12, starting in F major and modulating to C major. It introduces the main idea of upwards bouncing eighth notes followed by a tail of descending sixteenths, providing the musical motifs used to construct the rest of the piece. The first seven bars are in strict canon – both hands play the same melody, but the left hand starts one measure after the right hand! The second part starts in C major and lasts through bars 12-25, exploring the material using minor keys; a small drama in the middle of the joy. The final part starts in bar 26 and is a repeat of the material in bars 4-11, now transposed to begin in Bb major and end in F major, concluding the piece. | Background: The Inventions were originally written as ""Praeambula"" and ""Fantasiae"" in the Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, Johann Sebastian's eldest son, and later rewritten as musical exercises, designed to help students obtain a singing style of playing, but also to give them ""a strong foretaste of composition"".

It is structured similarly to a fugue in miniature, alternating entries of its main subject with longer episodes used to modulate to new keys. Carefully chosen and practiced fingerings will be key to letting the hands navigate the broken chords that wind up and down the keyboard with independence and ease. Musically, there are several approaches to character and articulation that could potentially suit the material, offering the pianist an excellent opportunity to sharpen their interpretative skills. For example, the minor key and musical motifs could imply an agitated, fiery character or a softer, graceful approach. The eighth notes can be played with a sharp staccato, a subtle portato, or even legato – or the articulation might even vary across the piece, with certain notes bound together, and others separated! | Background: The Inventions were originally written as ""Praeambula"" and ""Fantasiae"" in the Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, Johann Sebastian's eldest son, and later rewritten as musical exercises, designed to help students obtain a singing style of playing, but also to give them ""a strong foretaste of composition"".

Then Bach adds two simple broken chords, d minor and A7 to complete a subject and countersubject that has enough musical substance to form the basis of the whole invention. Using sequences and inversions (transposing the subject and turning it upside down) Bach creates a stirring, wave-like piece. The interplay between smooth legato sixteenth-notes and springy, dance-like eighth-notes pulls the music forward. The long trills, appearing in both hands, are an exciting feature. | Background: The Inventions were originally written as ""Praeambula"" and ""Fantasiae"" in the Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, Johann Sebastian's eldest son, and later rewritten as musical exercises, designed to help students obtain a singing style of playing, but also to give them ""a strong foretaste of composition"". Both the two-part Inventions and the three-part Sinfonias are arranged in order of ascending key, each group covering fifteen major and minor keys. | Practice & Performance Tips:: As you learn each invention, try to locate all the subjects, which might appear transposed. Practice the inventions hands separately. Try to memorize each hand first, in order to develop independence and touch control. Strive for an even playing. You may want to practice each voice (or each hand) non-legato first. Double check that your fingers are always relaxed before and after playing each note. Practice slowly! There are many ways to choose a fingering, but one of the best fingerings for the beginning of this invention (mm. 1-2) is 2-1-2-3-4-5-1-5-4-3-2-1). The left hand (mm. 3-4) can use the following fingering: 5-4-3-2-1-2-5-2-1-2-3-4). The time signature is 3/8, with three eighth notes per beat. However, the harmony changes at every downbeat. This is what we call harmonic rhythm. Try to analyze each measure harmonically and write down the chord in between the staves. For example, the first measure implies a D minor chord while the second measure implies an A Major chord. In the third measure, the left hand uses imitation and repeats the same notes (and therefore the same chord) of m. 1. The right hand outlines a D Minor chord too! Look at mm. 9-10 (right hand). These two measures form a sequence, which is a repeat of...

Virtually every note of the whole piece is derived from the first twelve notes, by means of transposition, inversion (turning the subject upside down) or augmentation (lengthening the note values). The concise, upward moving subject sounds happy and confident. A steady tempo and a clear sense of direction towards the first and third beats of each bar will give the piece a strong forward motion. Subtle crescendos and diminuendos can be used to bring out the melodic contour. | Background: The Inventions were originally written as ""Praeambula"" and ""Fantasiae"" in the Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, Johann Sebastian's eldest son, and later rewritten as musical exercises, designed to help students obtain a singing style of playing, but also to give them ""a strong foretaste of composition"".

https://www.pianostreet.com/beethoven-sheet-music/sonatas/sonata-23-appassionata-op-57.htm,Ludwig van Beethoven,"Sonata 23 (Appassionata) in F Minor, Op. 57",Beethoven’s own favorite piano sonata is dominated by a sense of anger and frustration - nothing can prepare you for the first movement’s violent outburst and crashing chords.,Sonatas,F Minor,1805,8+,Classical,"A cry of desperation: Beethoven’s Sonata in f minor op. 57 was composed when Beethoven was coming to terms with the fact that he was going deaf, and the frustration that he felt can be heard throughout the piece. After Beethoven’s death, it was given the unofficial title Appassionata, as it is considered one of the most emotionally tempestuous of Beethoven's piano works. The first movement begins with a slow, mysterious melody, played in unison. Soon the restrained atmosphere gives way to loud, intense outbursts. The ‘fate’ motive is everywhere, contrasting with the second, more lyrical subject. Dark and ominous sounds dominate this movement, and a sense of restlessness remains even during the brighter moments. The extremes of the piano are used to great effect. This movement demands a lot in terms of interpretative maturity and control of extreme dynamics. Things quiet down in the more introspective second movement, calling for exactness of timing in its very original and predominantly rhythmic variations on a drastically simple theme in D-flat major. The third movement returns to the emotional intensity of the first. It is an exercise in perpetual motion, partly strangely subdued and partly chaotic, testing the performer's stamina, but also the ability to distribute and hold back power. Czerny imagines ""the waves of the sea on a stormy night, whilst cries of distress are heard from afar"". At the end the storm is unleashed in a tumultuous, violent coda. It's often pointed out that this is Beethoven's only work to maintain a sense of tragic doom throughout. | Background: The Sonata in F minor opus 57 is known as the Appassionata (meaning ""passionate"" in Italian), but it was not given that name until after Beethoven's death, by the publisher of a four-hand arrangement of the work. According to Czerny, up to his writing his Hammerklavier-Sonata, Beethoven considered this his greatest sonata. In 1803, he had been given an Erard piano which had an extended range of five and a half octaves, which he uses at the very beginning of the sonata, going down to the lowest note available - the bottom F.","Downloadable piano sheet music from Sonatas by Ludwig van Beethoven to print: Sonata 23 (Appassionata) Op. 57 in F Minor (published in 1805) Sonata 23 (Appassionata) Op. 57 in F Minor, a composition by the classical composer Ludwig van Beethoven.

The ensuing Grave section requires interpretative maturity and careful considerations of the complex rhythms. The slow introduction gives way to a fast and explosive rising staccato motif, with a very fast broken octave accompaniment in the left hand. A third theme, which returns slightly transformed in the last movement of the sonata, has the right hand jumping back and forth from treble to bass. The second movement in A-flat major, far more familiar to the casual listener, is a soothing contrast. Here great attention is needed to voicing the thick textures in order to bring out the beautiful cantabile melody, one of Beethoven’s most beloved creations. The third movement is a driving, energetic rondo with long, complex phrases, requiring careful articulation and inflection. It contains elements of the first two, thereby tying the entire sonata together in a way that represents a significant development in the history of the piano sonata. | Background: Beethoven’s eighth piano sonata, in c minor, is one of the few works that the composer himself named, officially calling it Grande sonate pathétique. It is interesting to note that there are several similarities between the Pathétique Sonata and Mozart’s C minor sonata K. 457, as well as Bach's C minor Partita. For instance, the main theme of the slow movement of the Pathétique sounds remarkably similar to a theme in the slow movement of the Mozart sonata.","Ludwig van Beethoven: Sonata 8 (Pathétique) Op. 13 in C Minor from Sonatas - piano sheet music to print instantly.

It's the kind of soothingly beautiful but sad movement that can almost place a listener into a state of hypnosis. To create this hypnotic beauty, the pianist needs to excercise great control of the three different layers of music: bass line, triplet accompaniment, and melody. Less well known but indeed well worth exploring is the comparatively cheerful second movement - a Scherzo and trio in D-flat major, fairly straightforward but with interesting syncopated rhythms. Liszt called this movement ""a flower beetween abysses"". In the stormy third movement Presto, the broken chord triplets of the first movement are transformed into violently erupting arpeggios, covering three octaves. This dramatic composition, with typical Beethovenian sharp accents, presents substantial technical difficulties. | Background: The Piano Sonata op. 27 no. 2 in C-sharp minor has been better known as the Moonlight Sonata ever since Ludwig Rellstab, a German critic and poet, likened it to moonlight shining upon Lake Lucerne. The sonata was completed in 1801 and dedicated to the Countess Giulietta Guicciardi, a pupil of Beethoven, in 1802. | Practice & Performance Tips:: Beethoven instructs the performer to depress the sustain pedal for the entire duration of the first movement. (""Si deve suonare tutto questo pezzo delicatissimamente e senza sordino""). On most modern instruments, however, the effect will probably be too blurred if there are no pedal changes at all. But if that other main instruction is followed - to play softly and delicately throughout - it becomes possible to experiment a bit with the right pedal to achieve the sort of half-blurring that Beethoven was after. The next two movements are more difficult, but don’t hesitate to try the second movement Allegretto if you are an intermediate player, as it is a beautiful piece of music as well as an excellent exercise in articulation, rhythm, balance and control of touch. The last movement is really only for the most advanced pianists. The piece is like an erupting volcano, and it’s quite a feat to keep these continual explosions under control. However, focusing on the steadiness of the left hand part will help you to stay on top of...

Gripping and dramatic, it sees Beethoven experimenting with innovations of form, harmony, pedal, and dissonance. The tempestuous first movement is in sonata form and demonstrates many features unusual for the time. Highlights include a slow, tonally ambiguous introduction beginning on a mysterious, arpeggiated dominant chord in first inversion, anxious groups of quick, slurred eighth notes, a highly dramatic development section, and a recitative at the beginning of the recapitulation which replaces the expected return of most of the opening material, and where the pedal must be held down continuously, creating plaintive dissonances. The second and third movements are more traditional. The beginning of the second movement recalls the beginning of the first by opening with an arpeggiated chord in the same register, which this time leads to a slow and peaceful, almost pastoral movement. The final movement is again in sonata form and famed for its ghostlike and anxious main theme, contrasted with dramatic outbursts, an unusually long and improvisatory development section, and a coda extensive enough to function as a second development section before bringing the piece to a surprisingly quiet close. | Background: The Piano Sonata No. 17 in D minor was composed in 1801–02 and published together with his sonatas Nos. 16 and 18 as Op. 31 in 1803, marking the last time he grouped several sonatas under one opus number. In many ways, these sonatas highlight the beginning of Beethoven’s transition into his “Middle Period” compositional style (ca. 1802-1812), seeing him experiment with new and innovative ideas, both in terms of musical style and in his use of the sonata form. The Sonata’s nickname comes from early Beethoven biographer Anton Shindler's claim that Beethoven told him to read Shakespeare's “The Tempest” to understand how to interpret the sonata; unfortunately, Shindler’s reliability as a narrator has been heavily questioned in recent years.","Piano sheet music and recordings.

That’s 10 years after he wrote it, meaning that it predates even the first symphony. It’s a short work of just about eight minutes in length, it comprises only two movements, and it is also considered the easiest of all the Beethoven piano sonatas. Beethoven often held back pieces that he didn’t think were good enough or that he thought needed further improvement. In the case of this sonata and its immediate predecessor, it was Caspar van Beethoven, the composer's brother, who presented them to a publishing house, most likely against the composer's will. Had Beethoven himself released this sonata for publication, he would have called it a sonatina, owing to its modest proportions and simplified sonata form. This relaxed and playful piece doesn’t hint much at what would come later, but together with Sonata No. 19, the piece does show Beethoven’s quality even though he was feeling out the scope of his composing at the time.","Sonata 20 in G Major Op. 49 No. 2 by Ludwig van Beethoven.

This piece describes the world’s inexorable slide toward death and destruction by fire. Scriabin firmly believed that the world was storing heat and that it would destroy itself in a conflagration. The half-steps of the main melody stand in for tongues of flame, and the emotional turmoil of the piece signifies the way that fire devours objects and leaves them desiccated and destroyed. | Background: This piece was composed in 1914, when Scriabin was also planning his ""Gesamtkunstwerk"" Mysterium , a great enactment of music, dance, ceremony, color, and perfume, whose effect he hoped would be cosmic. He considered all his late works as preparations for a ""supreme ecstatic mystery"". Scriabin didn’t have long for this world at the time he wrote this piece. Less than a year later, he died of sepsis after a pimple on his lip became infected.",Vers la flamme: Poem Op. 72 (published in 1914) by Alexander Scriabin - piano sheet music to download and print instantly. Vers la flamme: Poem - Op. 72 is a piano piece by the late romantic composer Alexander Scriabin who lived between the years 1872 and 1915. The composition was first published in 1914 and is included in Miscellaneous pieces by Scriabin.,Vers la flamme,,"__NOTOC__ Vers la flamme (Toward the flame), Op. 72, is one of Alexander Scriabin's last pieces for piano, written in 1914. The main motif of the piece consists of descending half steps or whole steps interspersed with impressionistic representations of fire. The piece was originally intended to be Scriabin's eleventh sonata; however, he had to publish it early because of financial concerns, and hence he labelled it a poem rather than a sonata. Like many of Scriabin's late works, the piece does not conform to classical harmony and is instead built on the mystic chord and modal transpositions of its tone center. A typical performance last 5 to 6 minutes. The piece is notorious for its difficulty, in particular the enormous leaps and long, unusual double-note trills in the final pages. According to pianist Vladimir Horowitz, the piece was inspired by Scriabin's eccentric conviction that a constant accumulation of heat would ultimately cause the destruction of the world. The piece's title reflects the earth's fiery destruction, and the constant emotional buildup and crescendo throughout the piece lead, ultimately, ""toward the flame"". The piece has also been compared to Louis Brassin's piano transcription of Wagner's ""Magic Fire Music"" from Die Walkure. The piece was premiered on 14 March 1915 in Kharkiv, with Scriabin himself at the piano. Notable pianists who have performed the work include Horowitz, Sviatoslav Richter, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Arcadi Volodos and Grigory Sokolov. However, many of the most celebrated recordings are by specialists of Scriabin, such as Vladimir Sofronitsky, Ruth Laredo, Heinrich Neuhaus, Stanislav Neuhaus and Igor Zhukov. The piece has been orchestrated by composer-conductor Arkady Leytush. In 2018 Andrey Kasparov produced a treatment for piano duo.",,,,,,,,

It is dated 16 May 1789, the day before he left Leipzig. It was directly written into the notebook of Leipzig court organist . It is often cited as a tribute by Mozart to J. S. Bach, although many scholars have likened it to Handel's Gigue from the Suite No.&nbsp;8 in F&nbsp;minor, HWV&nbsp;433. In fact, the subject of the gigue bears a marked similarity to the subject of J. S. Bach's B minor fugue no. 24 from book 1 of The Well-Tempered Clavier. Mozart has changed the tempo from Largo to Allegro deciso and the time signature from common time to but the similarity between the two is unmistakable. The gigue consists of only 38 bars and is written in time. The bass line in the last four bars of the first half, and its transposed repetition in the second half before the coda, are notable for including all tones of the chromatic scale. However they are not tone rows as some tones are repeated. Tchaikovsky based the opening movement of his Mozartiana orchestral suite on this work.",,,,,,,,

He entered it into his Verzeichnis aller meiner Werke (Catalogue of all my Works) on 19 March 1788. At 57 measures, the duration of the piece is largely based on the performer's interpretation, including the decision of whether to do both repeats; it may last between and 16 minutes. The key of B minor is very rare in Mozart's compositions; it is used in only one other instrumental work, the slow movement from the Flute Quartet No. 1 in D major, K. 285. Mozart specifically noted the key of B minor in his catalogue, which he did for no other piece. In 1841 Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart used themes from this composition in his own Fest-Chor. The Austrian composer and academic Gerhard Präsent has made an arrangement for string quartet in four movements Fantasy Quartet in D in which this piece acts as the third one.

It was composed during the Classical period and is part of Mozart's Miscellaneous pieces.","Piece in F for Keyboard, K. 33B (Mozart)",Mozart,"The (Piece in F for keyboard), K. 33B/Anh.A 6, is a keyboard work written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart sometime during early October 1766; its tempo marking is Allegro. It is 26 bars long, divided into two sections of 12 and 14 bars, each repeated. It is suspected to be an arrangement of work by another composer. Mozart wrote this piece in pencil on the back of a circular by the Zürcher Musikkollegium (Zurich Music College) dated 30 September 1766, when the Mozart family came to the end of their Grand Tour. The circular invited sponsors, music lovers and other people who might be interested to concerts by ""the young (9 years old) Master Mozart as well as his maiden sister"" (Maria Anna – Nannerl) on October 7 and 9. It can be assumed that Mozart played or improvised this lively piece in one of those concerts, the programs to which are lost. Mozart wrote it on the back of the circular probably as a souvenir for the College's board; otherwise he would have used his sister's notebook or his third book of sketches ('), which is also lost. The autograph became known very late (in 1942), and so is missing from Alfred Einstein's 3rd edition of the Köchel catalogue. This piece appeared shortened in the 1984 film Amadeus, when the child Mozart played it blindfolded on the harpsichord and then on the violin.",,,,,,,,

It was the second of his four rondos, and is dedicated to the Countess Alexandrine de Moriolles, the daughter of the Count de Moriolles, who was the tutor to the adopted son of the Grand Duke Constantine, Governor of Warsaw. It is the only one of the four rondos not written in 2/4 time. Chopin wrote the piece while studying at the Warsaw Conservatory. It is a bravura piece, and technically more assured than his Opus 1, the Rondo in C minor. His teacher Józef Elsner had also written two rondos marked à la mazur, and they may have inspired the title, but Chopin's rondo displays none of Elsner's influence. Instead, there is much of Chopin's own originality. The opening theme, in F major, is in the rhythm of a mazurka. A second theme, in B-flat, marked Tranquillamente e cantabile, appears, before the main theme returns. The piece is notable for Chopin's very early use of the sharpened 4th degree characteristic of the Lydian mode. Robert Schumann first heard the Rondo à la mazur in 1836, and he called it ""lovely, enthusiastic and full of grace. He who does not yet know Chopin had best begin the acquaintance with this piece"".",,,,,,,,

Both works are approximately eight minutes in length, and are split into two movements. These sonatas are referred to as the Leichte Sonaten to be given to his friends and students. They are his first two numbered piano sonatas with only two movements rather than three or four. These two sonatas were possibly written around the time Beethoven composed the Third and Fourth sonatas, but because they were published in Vienna in 1805, nearly a decade after they were actually written, they were assigned then-current opus and sonata numbers, which classified them alongside works from the composer's middle period. Very similar circumstances caused Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 2 to appear as his second, even though it predated the first. Beethoven often suppressed works in his early years, either revising them later for publication or determining that they were not fit. In fact, he withheld many early works from publication for life. In the case of these two sonatas, it was Kaspar van Beethoven, the composer's brother, who decided they were worthy of publication. Against the composer's will, he presented them to a publishing house, thus allowing posterity to hear works that might otherwise have been lost or destroyed.",,,,,,,,

The last movement starts out by quoting the theme of the traditional ""Großvatertanz"" (Grandfather's Dance), which was always played at the end of a wedding or similar celebration.

,,,,,,,,,,,Piano Concerto No. 2 (Field),Field,"John Field's Piano Concerto in A-flat major (H. 31) was composed by 1811 and published in full first in Leipzig in 1816. It consists of the usual three movements, in a fast–slow–fast form: # Allegro moderato # Poco adagio # Rondo: Moderato innocente Field wrote the piece in classical sonata form; however, he didn't include a cadenza at the end of the first movement due to its relative length, and made the second movement quite short. Field wrote the composition using the more lyric, subdued, slightly melancholy style typical of late Mozart, rather than the joyous ""happy-go-lucky mood"" of Haydn or the bombastic display of Beethoven. In particular, it appears to have some influence from Mozart's famous Clarinet Concerto. In addition, it is imbued with lyric themes and even instrumental embellishments which are reminiscent of those from the composer's native Ireland. In three different sections of the first movement (first in E-flat, then F minor, and lastly A-flat), a lyric section with harp-like movements in the left hand is followed by a driving, audibly Irish-style reel which brings the section to a close with a Mozart-style cadential trill. The influence of his mentor Muzio Clementi (who was apparently an admirer of Mozart) was also important especially in the more Romantic features of the work. It has consistently been the most popular of Field's seven concertos. Composer and critic Robert Schumann rated it highly, and it was the only one never to go out of print at any time. Field's compositions were very popular in the 19th century, but he became relatively unknown during the 20th as musical fashions changed. Due to this, Field is not nearly as well known as contemporaries such as Felix Mendelssohn or Franz Schubert.",,,,,,,,

(Adams soon gave this work a companion, his Phrygian Gates, finished the next year. The latter is the longer of the two and uses similar techniques, but in terms of structure the pair have little in common.) China Gates is one of Adams' first mature works, which he wrote for the then 17-year-old pianist Sarah Cahill during a rainy season in northern California. Adams himself has suggested that the constant eighth notes of the piece reflect the steady rainfall of the time. The bass notes of the piece form the root of the mode, while the upper voices oscillate between different modes. K. Robert Schwarz has noted how the style of China Gates is in keeping with the ideas of ""process music"" of Steve Reich. The piece has a duration of about 4:50 minutes and is written in three parts. In the first part, the modes alternate between A-flat mixolydian and G-sharp aeolian, which sound almost like the major and minor versions of the same key. The third part alternates between F lydian and F locrian. The second part alternates more rapidly between all four modes.

Major changes between the two versions are indicated below, but many other small changes may be found, mostly additions to render the harmony more complex. * First variation: calmo e flessibile. No theme is stated in this piece. Like Webern's piano Variations a twelve-tone row stated at the beginning stands in for a theme. The first variation remains largely within the – range. It begins with a series of major ninths (the number nine plays a significant role in the structure of the piece) and gradually gains in rhythmic and harmonic complexity. * Second variation: poco meno del precedente. Mostly built on a sharp dotted motif but rapidly gains in speed and density, building up to a climax. * Third variation: prestissimo (e ben articulato). Fragments of motifs thrown around with rests and accents. A short cadenza (&nbsp;=&nbsp;104) intervenes (the designation ""cadenza"" is taken out in the revised version). Finally, a coda prestissimo, rapidly building up from very soft to extremely loud, closes this variation (the word ""coda"" is removed in the revised version). * Fourth variation: legatissimo e volante. Beginning , with rapid, highly chromatic scale passages (sometimes divided between the hands) and fragments of motifs tossed around. Builds to several climaxes. The bottom score of page 13 and the first two scores of page 14 are new to the revised version. * Fifth variation: calmo. Return to the pensive mood of the first variation, but with an intensely lyrical melody set among a large number of ornaments. The original version of the piece lacks almost all of these ornaments and is rhythmically far more simple and static (all the nonuplets are only found in the revised version). * Coda: Return to the stationary, ninth-dominated motives of the start, mostly in the range with much pedal.",Luciano Berio,,,,,,"1952, rev. 1966",

,,,,,,,,,,,Piano Concerto No. 12 (Mozart),Mozart,"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 12 in A major, K. 414 (385p), was written in the autumn of 1782 in Vienna. It is scored for solo piano (or harpsichord), two oboes, two bassoons (optional), two horns, and strings (consisting of violins, violas, cellos, and double basses). Like all three of the early Vienna concertos that Mozart wrote, it is a modest work that can be performed with only string quartet and keyboard (i.e., ). As per 18th-century performance practice, a string orchestra could also have served as a suitable option for the accompaniment. The concerto has three movements: #Allegro #Andante in D major #Allegretto in A major It was the first of a set of three keyboard concertos (with K. 413 and 415) that Mozart performed at his Lenten concerts in 1783. The concert rondo in A, K. 386, has often been discussed as an alternative finale to the work; however, K. 386 cannot be performed , and autograph evidence shows that the current finale starts on the same sheet as the end of the slow movement. Despite the modest nature and scoring of this concerto, it stands out in Mozart's early production. Although the three early Viennese concertos (Nos 11, 12 and 13) represent in some senses a formal regression compared to their immediate predecessors, especially No. 9 in E major, this concerto is a forerunner of the mature works in terms of its musical effect. The second movement is notable for its quotation of a theme from the overture to La calamita de' cuori by Johann Christian Bach, Mozart's former mentor in London, who had just died on 1 January 1782. Since at this point Mozart also wrote back to his father concerning Bach's death, saying of it ""what a loss to the musical world!"", the moving Andante may also be regarded as a musical epitaph by the younger man for the old master.",Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,A major,Köchel catalogue,,,,,"Three (''Allegro'', ''Andante'', ''Allegretto'')"

Originally conceived as a fantaisie for piano and orchestra, the symphony is unusual in that it is scored for a prominent (but never dominant) piano part together with orchestra, and has acquired the label sinfonia concertante from some critics. It consists of three movements and lasts just under half an hour: *Assez lent - Modérément animé *Assez modéré, mais sans lenteur *Animé The symphony begins with an evocative melody played first by a cor anglais. The main themes of subsequent movements are based on this melody, and as the symphony progresses each subsequent variation becomes more and more like the original version.

This fact is not universally accepted, however, and his performance as reproduced in 1997 for the Nimbus Records series The Composer Plays is certainly virtuosic. Additionally, none of the leading biographies of Prokofiev—those written by Harlow Robinson, Victor Seroff, and even Israel Nestyev—mention him having any technical problems beyond poor performance techniques in childhood, which were later rectified through years of study after his graduation from the Saint Petersburg Conservatory.

In January 1939 there was a radio broadcast which has survived as the only complete recording of the original version of the concerto. The work is cast into three movements: The first (Schwer, pesante in B minor) is an extensive sonata form movement of more than 30 minutes duration. A second movement follows, an Adagio solenne in D major influenced by Bruckner and Brahms; and lasting approximately 11 minutes. The last movement (Allegro moderato) is composed in free-form and has some hints of a rondo. Its duration is about 20 minutes and the work concludes in dark and gloomy mood with pianissimo dynamics. As a result of its ambivalent reception and technical difficulty, Furtwängler's Symphonic Concerto has rarely been performed in public. Extensive revisions were made to the score prior to its publication by Brucknerverlag of Wiesbaden in 1954. This is the version that has been performed since. The concerto has also been published in a critical edition edited by George Alexander Albrecht. The Brucknerverlag also published a two-piano reduction of the score.

,,,,,,,,,,,Petite symphonie concertante,,"Petite symphonie concertante, Op. 54, is an orchestral composition by the Swiss composer Frank Martin, one of his best-known works. Martin received the commission for the work in 1944, though progress was delayed by work on the oratorio In Terra Pax. The Petite symphonie concertante was completed the following year and received its premiere in Zürich on May 27, 1946 under the direction of Paul Sacher, the work's dedicatee. Sacher's commission prompted Martin to assume the unusual ensemble of harp, harpsichord, piano and string orchestra divided into two groups, though all accounts suggest the final choice of instruments was the composer's own. Using all of the common stringed instruments available, Martin desired to use the harp, harpsichord and piano not as accompanying, or 'basso continuo' instruments (as is often their role) but as solos, thus being a distant echo of J.S. Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 5, and justifying the work's title of symphonie concertante. The work gained Martin international recognition. The Petite symphonie concertante is in two movements, separated by the briefest of pauses. Each movement may then be divided into two 'halves', though the relationship between each part differs considerably between the two: the first comprises a slow introduction of forty-six bars out of which the following Allegro derives all of its motivic material; the second begins with an Adagio which showcases the three solo instruments (harp, piano, then harpsichord) before breaking into a lively march. The work is Neoclassical in outlook, and his approach reflects Martin's adoration of Bach. Martin's style draws elements from both the musical styles and traditions of France (such as the use of harmony to create local colour and the freer formal organisation) and Austro-Germany (such as the generally polyphonic style and the dense motivicism). The work also demonstrates Martin's use of the 12-tone technique, though in an entirely different way from the composers of the Second Viennese School. A 12-note row is apparent at the opening of the first movement, though Martin treats it as he does any other thematic or motivic material: it appears in various transpositions (all twelve, if fragmentary statements are included) but is never used in inversion, retrograde or retrograde-inversion forms, and is by no means present throughout the work. The row also demonstrates some other characteristic features of the composer's 12-tone technique, including the use of constant rhythmic values, no octave transpositions within the series, and the row's use frequently as an accompanimental ostinato. Later in the movement however, Martin does demonstrate his own take on the technique, common in the music of Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern and others, of 'telescoping' his row forms, that is, the final note of one statement is also the first of the next at a different transposition, though unlike these composers, Martin only uses fragments of each row form. The piece was intended for the so-called ""revival harpsichord"", the large early-20th-century instruments built in the piano tradition by makers such as Robert Goble and Pleyel. It is one of the few pieces in the sinfonia concertante genre to be composed in the twentieth century. Fearing that the unusual instrumentation of the ""Petite symphonie concertante"" might limit performances, Martin later rescored the work for a conventional large orchestra (without solo instruments) as the ""Symphonie concertante"".",,,,,,,,

They are known as his Handel Variations. The music writer Donald Tovey has ranked it among ""the half-dozen greatest sets of variations ever written"". Biographer Jan Swafford describes the Handel Variations as ""perhaps the finest set of piano variations since Beethoven"", adding, ""Besides a masterful unfolding of ideas concluding with an exuberant fugue with a finish designed to bring down the house, the work is quintessentially Brahms in other ways: the filler of traditional forms with fresh energy and imagination; the historical eclectic able to start off with a gallant little tune of Handel's, Baroque ornaments and all, and integrate it seamlessly into his own voice, in a work of massive scope and dazzling variety.""

,,,,,,,,,,,"Ballades, Op. 10 (Brahms)",Brahms,"The Ballades, Op.&nbsp;10, are lyrical piano pieces written by Johannes Brahms during his youth. They were dated 1854 and were dedicated to his friend Julius Otto Grimm. Their composition coincided with the beginning of the composer's lifelong affection for the pianist and composer Clara Schumann, who was helping Brahms launch his career. Frédéric Chopin had written the last of his famous ballades only 12 years earlier, but Brahms approached the genre differently from Chopin, choosing to take its origin in narrative poetry more literally. Brahms's ballades are arranged in two pairs of two, the members of each pair being in parallel keys. The first ballade was inspired by a Scottish poem ""Edward"" found in a collection Stimmen der Völker in ihren Liedern compiled by Johann Gottfried Herder. It is also one of the best examples of Brahms's bardic or Ossianic style; its open fifths, octaves, and simple triadic harmonies are supposed to evoke the sense of a mythological past. # D minor. Andante # D major. Andante # B minor. Intermezzo. Allegro # B major. Andante con moto The tonal center of each ballade conveys an interconnectedness between the four pieces: the first three each include the key signature of the ballade that follows it somewhere as a tonal center, and the fourth ends in the key signature of D major/B minor despite cadencing in B major. Brahms returned to the wordless ballade form in writing the third of the Six Pieces for Piano, Op. 118. His Op.&nbsp;75 vocal duets titled ""Ballads and Romances"" include a setting of the poem ""Edward""—the same that inspired Op.&nbsp;10, No.&nbsp;1.

Beethoven did write a second finale for it in 1798 for performance in Prague, but that is not the finale that was published. It was used by the composer as a vehicle for his own performances as a young virtuoso, initially intended with the Bonn Hofkapelle. It was published in December 1801 as Op. 19, later than the publication in March that year of his later composition the Piano Concerto No. 1 in C&nbsp;major as Op. 15, and thus became designated as his second piano concerto. The B-flat major Piano Concerto was an important display piece for the young Beethoven as he sought to establish himself after moving from Bonn to Vienna. He may have premiered it on 29 March 1795, at Vienna's Burgtheater in a concert marking his public debut. He revised the concerto repeatedly, in 1790, 1793, 1794-1795, 1798 and 1801. However, the pianist Peter Serkin has noted that Beethoven's writing of the cadenza of the first movement much later than the concerto proper ""indicates [his] own regard for his early concerto"".

Chronologically, the work is the twentieth of Mozart's 23 original piano concertos. The work is one of only two minor-key piano concertos that Mozart composed, the other being the No. 20 in D minor. None of Mozart's other piano concertos features a larger array of instruments: the work is scored for strings, woodwinds, horns, trumpets and timpani. The first of its three movements, Allegro, is in sonata form and is longer than any opening movement of Mozart's earlier concertos. The second movement, Larghetto, in E major—the relative major of C minor—features a strikingly simple principal theme. The final movement, Allegretto, is a theme and eight variations in C minor.

Two of the remaining preludes not published were rearranged for solo violin and piano and published as Short Story. Of the other two, the Prelude in G was eliminated by the publisher because somewhat similar music had already appeared in Gershwin's Concerto in F. The other was excluded for unknown reasons.

,,,,,,,,,,,Piano Trio No. 2 (Schubert),Schubert,"The Piano Trio No. 2 in E major for piano, violin, and cello, D. 929, was one of the last compositions completed by Franz Schubert, dated November 1827. It was published by Probst as Opus 100 in late 1828, shortly before the composer's death and first performed at a private party in January 1828 to celebrate the engagement of Schubert's school-friend Josef von Spaun. The Trio was among the few of his late compositions Schubert heard performed before his death. It was given its first private performance by Carl Maria von Bocklet on the piano, Ignaz Schuppanzigh playing the violin, and Josef Linke playing cello. Like Schubert's other piano trio, this is a comparatively larger work than most piano trios of the time, taking almost 50 minutes to perform. The second theme of the first movement is based loosely on the opening theme of the Minuet and Trio of Schubert's G major sonata (D. 894). Scholar Christopher H. Gibbs asserts direct evidence of Beethoven's influence on the Trio. The main theme of the second movement was used as one of the central musical themes in Stanley Kubrick's 1975 film Barry Lyndon. It has also been used in a number of other films, including The Hunger, Crimson Tide, The Piano Teacher, L'Homme de sa vie, Land of the Blind, Recollections of the Yellow House, The Way He Looks, The Mechanic, Miss Julie, The Congress, the HBO miniseries John Adams, the FX miniseries Mrs. America, two episodes of American Crime Story, as the opening piece for the ABC documentary The Killing Season, used throughout the BBC documentary Auschwitz: The Nazis and 'The Final Solution, and in the 2023 biographical film, Dance First, about Irish playwright Samuel Beckett.

,,,,,,,,,,,Piano Sonata No. 26 (Beethoven),Beethoven,".]] Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 26 in E major, Op. 81a, known as Les Adieux (""The Farewell""), was written during the years 1809 and 1810. This sonata was influenced by Jan Ladislav Dussek's sonata with the same nickname. The title ' implies a programmatic nature. The French attack on Vienna, led by Napoléon Bonaparte in 1809, forced Beethoven's patron, Archduke Rudolph, to leave the city. Yet, there is some uncertainty about this nature of the piece — or at least, about the degree to which Beethoven wished this programmatic nature should be known. He titled the three movements """", """", and """" ('farewell', 'absence', and 'reunion'), and reportedly regarded the French """" (said to whole assemblies or cities) as a poor translation of the feeling of the German """" (said heartfully to a single person). Indeed, Beethoven wrote the syllables """" over the first three chords. On the first 1811 publication, a dedication was added reading ""On the departure of his Imperial Highness, for the Archduke Rudolph in admiration"". An average performance of the piece lasts about 17 minutes. The sonata is one of Beethoven's most challenging sonatas because of the mature emotions that must be conveyed throughout as well as the technical difficulties involved. It is also the bridge between his middle period and his later period and is considered the third great sonata of the middle period.",,,,,,,,

Beethoven maintains a playful jocularity throughout much of the piece, but as in many of his early works, the jocular style can be heard as a facade, concealing profound ideas and depths of emotion.

,,,,,,,,,,,Piano Sonata No. 31 (Beethoven),Beethoven,"The Piano Sonata No. 31 in A major, Op. 110, by Ludwig van Beethoven was composed in 1821 and published in 1822. It is the middle piano sonata in the group of three (Opp. 109, 110, and 111) that he wrote between 1820 and 1822, and is the penultimate of his piano sonatas. Though the sonata was commissioned in 1820, Beethoven did not begin work on Op. 110 until the latter half of 1821, and final revisions were completed in early 1822. The delay was due to factors such as Beethoven's work on the Missa solemnis and his deteriorating health. The original edition was published by Schlesinger in Paris and Berlin in 1822 without dedication, and an English edition was published by Muzio Clementi in 1823. The work is in three movements. The Moderato first movement follows a typical sonata form with an expressive and cantabile opening theme. The Allegro second movement begins with a terse but humorous scherzo, which Martin Cooper believes is based on two folk songs, followed by a trio section. The last movement comprises multiple contrasting sections: a slow introductory recitative, an arioso dolente, a fugue, a return of the arioso, and a second fugue that builds to a passionate and heroic conclusion. William Kinderman finds parallels between the last movement's fugue and other late works by Beethoven, such as the fughetta in the Diabelli Variations and sections of the Missa solemnis, and Adolf Bernhard Marx favourably compares the fugue to those of Bach and Handel. The sonata is the subject of musical analyses including studies by Donald Tovey, Denis Matthews, Heinrich Schenker, and Charles Rosen.

Uhland's """" (exalted love) is saintly or religious love: the ""martyr"" renounces worldly love and ""heaven has opened its gates"". The second song """" (blessed death) is often known by its first line ("""", ""I had died""), and evokes erotic love; (""I was dead from love's bliss; I lay buried in her arms; I was wakened by her kisses; I saw heaven in her eyes"").

The third and fourth pieces in the first set were published in 1857 (although the third piece was printed by the publisher in G major, instead of G as Schubert had written it, and remained available only in this key for many years). The two sets are now catalogued as D. 899 and D. 935 respectively. They are considered to be among the most important examples of this popular early 19th-century genre. Three other unnamed piano compositions (D. 946), written in May 1828, six months before the composer's death, are known as both ""Impromptus"" and Klavierstücke (""piano pieces""). The Impromptus are often considered companion pieces to the Six moments musicaux, and they are often recorded and published together. It has been said that Schubert was deeply influenced in writing these pieces by the Impromptus, Op. 7 (1822) of Jan Václav Voříšek and by the music of Voříšek's teacher Václav Tomášek.",,,,,,,,

T. A. Hoffmann. Schumann dedicated the pieces to Fräulein Anna Robena Laidlaw, an accomplished 18-year-old Scottish pianist with whom Schumann had become good friends. Schumann composed the pieces with the characters Florestan and Eusebius in mind, representing the duality of his personality.

The calm, slow melodies of these pieces are built up from paired phrases reminiscent of plainchant.

The first of the composer's three mature sonatas (the others being the Piano Sonata No.&nbsp;3 in B minor, Op.&nbsp;58 and the Sonata for Piano and Cello in G minor, Op.&nbsp;65), the work is considered to be one of the greatest piano sonatas of the literature.

,,,,,,,,,,,Asturias (Leyenda),Leyenda,"Asturias (Leyenda), named simply Prelude by its composer, is a musical work by the Spanish composer and pianist Isaac Albéniz (1860–1909). is an example of the use of a pedal note.]] The piece, which lasts around six minutes in performance, was originally written for the piano and set in the key of G minor. It was first published in Barcelona, by Juan Bta. Pujol & Co., in 1892 as the prelude of a three-movement set entitled Chants d'Espagne. The name Asturias (Leyenda) was given to it posthumously by the German publisher Hofmeister, who included it in the 1911 ""complete version"" of the Suite española, although Albéniz never intended the piece for this suite. Despite the new name, this music is not considered suggestive of the folk music of the northern Spanish region of Asturias, but rather of Andalusian flamenco traditions (although the drama of the music is congruent with the landscape of the region of Asturias). The origin of the presumably misattributed name was that in fact Albéniz did compose a piano work actually called (by himself) 'Asturias', which made part of a set of pieces of folk music from all over Spain for the then Queen of Spain, but this piece is lost, and maybe its name was passed on the now so called one. Leyenda, Hofmeister's subtitle, means legend. The piece is noted for the delicate, intricate melody of its middle section and abrupt dynamic changes. Albéniz's biographer, Walter Aaron Clark, describes the piece as ""pure Andalusian flamenco"". In the main theme the piano mimics the guitar technique of alternating the thumb and fingers of the right hand, playing a pedal-note open string with the index finger and a melody with the thumb. The theme itself suggests the rhythm of the bulería—a fast flamenco form. The ""marcato""/""staccato"" markings suggest both guitar sounds and the footwork of a flamenco dancer. The piece sounds as though it is written in the Phrygian mode which is typical of bulerías. The second section is reminiscent of a copla—a sung verse following a specific form. Clark states that it is written in typical Albéniz form as it is ""presented monophonically but doubled at the fifteenth for more fullness of sound."" The music alters between a solo and accompaniment that is typical of flamenco. The short middle section of the piece is written in the style of a malagueña—another flamenco style piece. The malagueña borrows two motives from the previous copla and builds on them. The piece returns to its first theme until a slow ""hymn-like"" passage ends the piece.",,,,,,,,

The piece established his fame as a concerto composer and is one of his most enduringly popular pieces. After the disastrous 1897 premiere of his First Symphony, Rachmaninoff suffered a psychological breakdown and depression that prevented composition for three years. In 1899, he was supposed to perform the Second Piano Concerto in London, which he had not composed yet, and instead made a successful conducting debut. The success led to an invitation to return next year with his First Piano Concerto; however, he promised to reappear with a newer and better one. After an unsuccessful meeting with Leo Tolstoy meant to revoke his writer's block, relatives decided to introduce Rachmaninoff to the neurologist Nikolai Dahl, whom he visited daily from January to April 1900. Rachmaninoff dedicated the concerto to Dahl for successfully treating him by restoring his health and confidence in composition. From the summer to the autumn of 1900, he worked on the second and third movements of the concerto, with the first movement causing him difficulties.

Much of it (the first suite in particular) derives from an earlier work, Album d'un voyageur, his first major published piano cycle, which was composed between 1835 and 1838 and published in 1842. Années de pèlerinage is widely considered as the masterwork and summation of Liszt's musical style. While the first two offerings are often considered music of a young man, the third volume is notable as an example of his later style. Composed well after the first two volumes, it displays less virtuosity and more harmonic experimentation. The title Années de pèlerinage refers to Goethe's famous novel of self-realization, Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, and especially its sequel Wilhelm Meister's Journeyman Years (whose original title Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre meant Years of Wandering or Years of Pilgrimage, the latter being used for its first French translation).

The Bagatelle is a waltz in a typical sectioned dance form, with repeated sections given inventive variation. While this piece is not especially dissonant, it is extremely chromatic, becoming what Liszt's contemporary François-Joseph Fétis called ""omnitonic"" in that it lacks any definite feeling for a tonal center. Some critics have suggested, however, that the various underpinnings of the piece—in other words, the main bass notes and melodic elements—work together to imply an underlying tonality of D, which would link the Bagatelle in terms of tonality with the Fourth Mephisto Waltz.",,,,,,,,

It was first performed in 1943 in Chicago by Willard MacGregor. The piece explores ""matters of technique, theory, inspiration, and communication. It is in effect, a veritable catalogue of the composer's mature style."" The piece, which comprises all 12 major or minor keys, starts with a three-part Praeludium in C resembling Johann Sebastian Bach's toccatas, and ends with a Postludium which is an exact retrograde inversion of the Praeludium. In between, there are twelve three-part fugues separated by eleven interludes, beginning in the tonality of the previous fugue and ending in the tonality of the next fugue (or in a different tonality very close to that). The tonalities of the fugues follow the order of his Serie 1 and use the keynote C (see The Craft of Musical Composition). Ludus Tonalis was intended to be the twentieth-century equivalent to J.S. Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier. Unlike Bach's work, though, the non-fugal pieces in Ludus Tonalis frequently repeat the work's main theme. Ludus Tonalis can be thought of as the most direct application of Hindemith's theory that the twelve tones of the equally tempered scale all relate to a single one of them (called a tonic or keynote). The affinity of each note with the keynote is directly related to its position on the harmonic scale. In this system, the major-minor duality is meaningless and the practice of modulation is dropped, although subject modulation occurs in the second fugue, to create growing tension. The first performance of Ludus Tonalis in Italy was played by Eunice Katunda in 1948 at the Teatro Piccolo in Milan.",,,,,,,,

He was celebrated in his lifetime for his operas, of which he composed more than twenty, but he also wrote ballet music, works for piano and choral pieces. He is best known today for the ballet La Fille mal gardée and the overture to the opera Zampa. Born in Paris to a musical family, Hérold trained at the Paris Conservatoire and won France's premier musical prize, the Prix de Rome in 1812. After a time in Italy he returned to Paris and worked first at the Théâtre Italien and then at the Opéra. He wrote several ballets for the latter, but was best known as a composer of opéra comique. Some of them, particularly in his early days, were hampered by poor librettos, but later he had more successes than failures, and his last two operas, Zampa (1831) and Le Pré aux clercs (The Clerk's Meadow, 1832) were immensely popular, and remained in the repertory in France and elsewhere for decades after his early death from tuberculosis in 1833. As a ballet composer Hérold was a pioneer, raising the standard of ballet scores from being simple arrangements of popular tunes to well-orchestrated music illustrating the action of the ballets. His operas influenced later composers from Bizet and Offenbach to Wagner and Smetana.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,Opus clavicembalisticum,,"Opus clavicembalisticum (Latin: ""Piece for Keyboard"") is a work for piano solo by English composer-pianist Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji, written from 1929 to 25 June 1930. Notable for its unprecedented length, rhythmic and harmonic complexity and extreme difficulty, it was premièred in Glasgow by its author in the year of its completion. By its time of completion, Opus clavicembalisticum was the longest and possibly most technically demanding piano piece in existence, taking around 4– hours to play, depending on tempi. However, various works by New Complexity, modernist and avant-garde composers, along with Sorabji himself, have since surpassed its statures: several of his later works, such as the Symphonic Variations for piano (approximate duration nine hours), exceed its length. It is in these areas that Opus clavicembalisticum is esteemed and primarily receives its reputation. Sorabji may have partly been inspired to compose the work after hearing Egon Petri perform Ferruccio Busoni's Fantasia contrappuntistica; to an extent, Opus clavicembalisticum is an homage to the Fantasia. Sorabji's earlier Toccata No. 1 (1928) (likewise for piano solo and in multiple movements) exudes similar Busonian influence—in some ways prefiguring Opus clavicembalisticum. The score, though strewn with errors consequent of the composer's dauntingly illegible manuscript, was published by J.

,,,,,,,,,,,Frühlingsrauschen,,"Frühlingsrauschen, Op. 32, No. 3 ('Rustle of Spring') is a solo piano piece written by the Norwegian composer Christian Sinding (1856–1941) in 1896. It is Sinding's most popular piece of music. The piece is written in salon style as a piece meant for entertainment, and was very popular in the United States. Bearing the expression marking agitato, much of the piece is played with a rapid arpeggio in the right hand part, while the left hand carries the melody. The work's title indicates that its sense of constant motion is symbolic of the excited restlessness of springtime. The score has some technically challenging sections, but is, for the most part, easier to play than it sounds, with most of the rapidity made up of simply arpeggiated passages. For its popularity and ability to impress, the piece is a common part of many pianists' repertoires. The piece is in D-flat major, and several times shifts to related keys such as F minor and A-flat major, as well as modulating via chromatic harmonies to more remote keys like G minor and A major. Its form may be summed up thus: * (a) 16-bar main theme, starting in B-flat minor, passing through F minor, and ending in A-flat major (the dominant); * (b) 14-bar extension to main theme, beginning in F minor, and further developing the theme, and moving via sequence through G minor and A major, before shifting suddenly back to D-flat major as a climax; * (c) Varied repetition of (a); * (d) Varied repetition of (b); * (e) Near-exact repetition of (a) (except for first 4 bars, which are varied yet again); * (f) Exact repetition of (b); * (g) Coda, consisting of shortened version of (a) (varied in the same manner as (c)), this time staying in D-flat major instead of modulating, followed by a cadence based on this theme, and decorated by extensive scale and arpeggio passages. An orchestral version of Rustle of Spring appears as part of the score to Harman and Ising's 1936 Happy Harmonies cartoon The Early Bird and the Worm. The piece features prominently in the 1939 Hollywood film Intermezzo, first in an orchestral arrangement, and then with its main melody hummed and played on piano by Ingrid Bergman's character Anita Hoffman. Its melody is quoted in a few parts of Meredith Willson's 1957 musical The Music Man. The piece also appears in the second episode of Dennis Potter's 1986 TV series The Singing Detective.

Each Moment musical reproduces a musical form characteristic of a previous musical era. The forms that appear in Rachmaninoff's incarnation are the nocturne, song without words, barcarolle, virtuoso étude, and theme and variations. The individual pieces have been described as ""true concert works, being best served on a stage and with a concert grand."" Although composed as part of a set, each piece stands on its own as a concert solo with individual themes and moods. In an interview in 1941, Rachmaninoff said, ""What I try to do, when writing down my music, is to make it say simply and directly that which is in my heart when I am composing."" Even though Moments musicaux were written because he was short of money, the pieces summarize his knowledge of piano composition up to that point. Andante cantabile is a contrast to its two surrounding pieces, explicitly named ""funeral march"" and ""lament.""

The development section is almost entirely based on the last four bars of the exposition. The second movement has an episodic structure A–B–A–B–A–coda. The second theme's melody is gently decorated with syncopation, accompanied by broken chords in the left hand. This key is G major, the subdominant of D major. Lastly, the most technically demanding movement of the three is a sonata rondo, with a short central episode in B minor (the main key's relative minor).

The work was favorably received by the press and public. Strauss submitted it to a competition of the Berliner Tonkünstlerverein and was awarded the first prize out of 24 entries.

The suite was commissioned by the Tcherepnin Society for the pianist Eric Himy, who played its world premiere that October 14 at Alice Tully Hall in New York City. The score exemplifies Liebermann's modernist style, in which tonal harmony and expressive gestures grounded in tradition coexist with avant-garde procedures. The piece has become one of Liebermann's most popular efforts, receiving more than ten recordings. Many cathedral gargoyles portray grotesque faces with great humor, and Liebermann intends precisely that in his pieces, which have the mordant wit of Sergei Prokofiev's ""bad boy"" style in their ancestry. The brief opening movement commences with an arresting three-note “signal” and move forward with perpetual motion rhythms, the narrative studded with shock-effects. The following Adagio semplice, by contrast, is deeply introverted, presenting melancholy melodizing over patterns based on two alternating chords. Later, a still slower melody unfolds against repetitions of a single note. Crystalline sonorities mark the third Gargoyle which floats a songful theme over luminous liquid swirls, and ultimately develops into a duet. Mordancy and menace return in the finale, which is dominated by demonic galloping rhythms, as textures grow steadily more dense and virtuoso gestures steadily more flamboyant.",,,,,,,,

They are: # A Grecian Lad # The Boy Bishop # Puck's Birthday A pastel is an artwork made using a colouring medium in the form of a stick which consists of powdered pigment and a binder; the stick too is called a pastel. Pastel drawings are often delicate in tone, which may explain Ireland's choice of title for this set of gentle impressionistic pieces. The title A Grecian Lad may have been taken from A. E. Housman's poem ""Look not in my eyes, for fear"", No. XV in his 1896 collection A Shropshire Lad. It refers to the Greek legend of Narcissus, who fell in love with his own reflection: : A Grecian lad, as I hear tell, : One that many loved in vain, : Looked into a forest well : And never looked away again. : There, when the turf in springtime flowers, : With downward eye and gazes sad, : Stands amid the glancing showers : A jonquil, not a Grecian lad. The jonquil is a species of narcissus, Narcissus jonquilla. In the Middle Ages, it was a widespread custom to appoint a boy bishop, for example from among cathedral choristers, to parody the actual bishop on some particular church feast day.

Their titles are: # The Island Spell # Moonglade # The Scarlet Ceremonies The set was reviewed by the Monthly Musical Record in August 1915, as follows: ""These three pieces are well named, since they are the most successful pieces of pictorial writing we have encountered since the advent of Maurice Ravel, whose style they somewhat resemble as regards technique. Magic seas and fairy woods are evoked by the subtlest art in the first piece, “The Island Spell”. Is it by accident that one conjures up the magic music of Shakespeare's Tempest? An all-pervading mood is here, as with the best types of decorative music. There is a curious compelling charm and feeling of remoteness about the “Moon-Glade”, also written over a poem of Arthur Symons commencing “Why are you so sorrowful in dreams?” This piece is pure impressionism. The fading tonality at the close, so like the stuff dreams are made of, is a wonderful piece of tone-artistry. The third movement entitled “The Scarlet Ceremonies” is the most striking of the set. It is founded on a quotation from Arthur Machen’s “The White People”. Against a continuously palpitating pattern in the right hand a trumpet-like theme is given out by the left. The whole movement is evolved from the first twelve bars or so. The theme passes to the right hand later on, appearing over a fluttering figure of fourths in the bass. There is an original “pedal-point” effect at the end, and a new double glissando of white and black notes which will be responsible for many grazed fingers. Originality breathes in every bar of the Decorations, and the composer evidently possesses peculiar magic powers in the world of sound.""",,,,,,,,

The pieces are: # Le Catioroc # In a May Morning # Song of the Springtides Sarnia is an ancient Roman name for the island of Guernsey, one of the Channel Islands. Le Catioroc is a Neolithic site in Saint Saviour, Guernsey. A spring tide is an especially high or low tide. The name has nothing to do with the season of the year, it derives from the meaning ""jump, burst forth, rise"", as in a natural spring. Spring (and the opposite, neap) tides result from the relative positions of Earth, Moon and Sun. If the Sun and Moon's gravitational effects reinforce each other, there will be a spring tide; if they oppose each other, a neap. Ireland often visited the Channel Islands. He had composed The Island Spell (the first piece of the three in his 1913 set of piano pieces Decorations) while visiting the island of Jersey in 1912.

He dedicated it to his friend, the conductor and BBC music producer, Edward Clark. A performance takes about 10½ minutes. The movements are marked: # Moderato # Quasi lento # Rondo. Ritmico, non troppo allegro The term sonatina has no single strict definition, but is rather a title applied by the composer to a piece in basic sonata form which is shorter and lighter in character, or technically more elementary, than a typical sonata. The dates given at the end of the score ('Begun, June 1926: finished, October 1927') suggest that the work cost Ireland some considerable effort despite its brevity. The writing is extremely dense, even by Ireland's standards, and experimental in both its harmonic language and form. John Longmire relates that the 'CAD' motive in the second theme of the first movement refers to the composer Arnold Bax. Ireland had a strong affection for Faery, the younger daughter of the Hutchesons of the White House, Great Sampford. Arnold Bax 'appeared on the scene and stole her affection from him'. Ireland's revenge was this theme. Despite his offence at Bax's behaviour, the two composers remained friends. The Rondo was used as a test piece in the 1928 Daily Express Piano Competition, which was won by Cyril Smith. It had been recorded by William Murdoch as a guide to competitors. Lewis Foreman has written, ""that Ireland even then recognised the piano not only for its romantic and singing qualities, but also - almost Bartók like - as a percussion instrument"". It recounts the tale of a spinster who renounces her city life with relatives in London to move to the village of Great Mop, where she forges a pact with the devil and becomes a witch. She is invited to a witches' sabbath where 'they whirled faster and faster, fused together like two suns that whirl and blaze in a single destruction'. In a letter to Jocelyn Brooke, Ireland wrote that 'Sylvia Townsend Warner has something in ""Lolly Willowes""... But she tinges nearly all with an underlying irony which is sometimes stimulating but often destructive'.",,,,,,,,

The first edition was published in February 1807 in Vienna. Unlike the early Sonata No. 8, Pathétique, the Appassionata was not named during the composer's lifetime, but was so labelled in 1838 by the publisher of a four-hand arrangement of the work. Instead, Beethoven's autograph manuscript of the sonata has ""La Pasionata"" written on the cover, in Beethoven's hand. One of his greatest and most technically challenging piano sonatas, the Appassionata was considered by Beethoven to be his most tempestuous piano sonata until the twenty-ninth piano sonata (known as the Hammerklavier). 1803 was the year Beethoven came to grips with the irreversibility of his progressive hearing loss.

Allan—whose brother, Mozart Allan, was a music publisher—was sixteen when she composed the piece, with arrangements for solo and duet. The title ""Chop Waltz"" comes from Allan's specification that the melody be played in two-part harmony with both hands held in a vertical orientation, little fingers down and palms facing each other, striking the keys with a chopping motion.

Having studied music from an early age, he studied at the Paris Conservatoire and won its top prize, the Prix de Rome at his first attempt, despite studies interrupted by his service in World War I. Ibert pursued a successful composing career, writing (sometimes in collaboration with other composers) seven operas, five ballets, incidental music for plays and films, works for piano solo, choral works, and chamber music. He is probably best remembered for his orchestral works including Divertissement (1930) and Escales (1922). As a composer, Ibert did not attach himself to any of the prevalent genres of music of his time, and has been described as an eclectic. This is seen even in his best-known pieces: Divertissement for small orchestra is lighthearted, even frivolous, and Escales (1922) is a ripely romantic work for large orchestra. In tandem with his creative work, Ibert was the director of the Académie de France at the Villa Medici in Rome. During World War II he was proscribed by the pro-Nazi government in Paris, and for a time he went into exile in Switzerland. Restored to his former eminence in French musical life after the war, his final musical appointment was in charge of the Paris Opera and the Opéra-Comique.",,,,,,,,

The theme and its accompanying chords are written using enharmonic notation. The piece is undated, but scholars usually assign a date around 1893–1894 on the basis of musical and biographical evidence. The piece bears the inscription ""In order to play the motif 840 times in succession, it would be advisable to prepare oneself beforehand, and in the deepest silence, by serious immobilities.""

Beethoven composed the concerto in 1809 under salary in Vienna, and he dedicated it to Archduke Rudolf, who was his patron, friend, and pupil. Its public premiere was on 28 November 1811 in Leipzig, with Friedrich Schneider as the soloist and Johann Philipp Christian Schulz conducting the Gewandhaus Orchestra. Beethoven, usually the soloist, could not perform due to declining hearing. The work's military aspects and symbolism characterize its heroic style. Beethoven used novel approaches with the piece, such as beginning the solo entrance without orchestral introduction, lengthening the concerto, and creating a new relationship between piano and orchestra. The first of its three movements, Allegro, is in sonata form and is longer than any opening movement of Beethoven's earlier piano concertos. The second movement, Adagio un poco mosso, is a nocturne that directly builds into the third movement. The last movement, Rondo: Allegro ma non troppo, is in seven-part rondo form. The concerto is approximately forty minutes. The origin of the epithet Emperor is uncertain; it may have been coined by Johann Baptist Cramer, the English publisher of the concerto. The concerto has no association with any emperor, and according to Donald Tovey and Betsy Schwarm, Beethoven would have disliked it due to his disapproval of Napoleon's conquest. As part of his repertoire, Franz Liszt frequently performed the concerto throughout his life.

Its success led to Joplin being dubbed the ""King of Ragtime"" by his contemporaries. The piece gave Joplin a steady if unspectacular income for the rest of his life. Despite ragtime's decline after Joplin's death in 1917, the ""Maple Leaf Rag"" continued to be recorded by many well-known artists.

Scriabin originated in a country house on the estate of Obraztsovo-Karpovo, Serpukhov district, Moscow province (now Bolshoe Obraztsovo, Stupino city district, Moscow region). As one of the late piano sonatas of Scriabin's career, the music is highly chromatic and almost atonal. George Perle says that, ""the primary set upon which the Seventh Sonata is based,"" is, in linear order as spelled by Scriabin, E, F, G, A, B, C, D, and that the mystic chord may be derived from the quartal spelling of this set (with D and without G).",,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,Piano Sonata No. 10 (Scriabin),Scriabin,"The Piano Sonata No. 10, Op. 70, was written by Alexander Scriabin in 1913. It was his final work in this form. The piece is highly chromatic and tonally ambiguous like Scriabin's other late works, although arguably less dissonant than most of his late works. It is characterized by frequent trills and tremolos. It is sometimes called his ""Insect Sonata"", in reference to the following statement he made that was recorded by Leonid Sabaneev: ""Insects, butterflies, moths - they are all living flowers. They are the most subtle caresses, almost without touching...They are all born of the sun and the sun nourishes them...This sunlike caress is the closest to me - take my tenth sonata - it is an entire sonata from insects."" This statement originates in a conversation in which Scriabin, his common-law-wife Tatiana Scriabina, and Sabaneev discuss the ways that various animals ""correspond to the movements of our souls."" The atmosphere of the introductory pages of the Tenth Sonata is veiled and distant, like an impressionist reflection, but much more intensely elevated and spiritual. Trills soon sweep into every corner of the music, and in the last pages they are transformed into a glorious reverberation, as if shimmering with pulses of glowing light and taking on lives of their own. Such life and light/sound corroborations are typical of the composer's own imaginative world. The tenth sonata is in closer dialogue with Sonata Form than some of his other sonatas. It opens with a few desolate notes, forming an augmented chord and then a diminished chord. Then, it moves on to a simple chromatic theme, and then back to the opening theme. Scriabin then introduces the luminous trills that pervade the rest of the piece, and then moves on to a third theme with a chromatically descending melody. Following the sonata format, these three themes take on a modified form in the development before settling down to the recapitulation. During the middle portion, the feverish buzzing rises to a ferocious climax that thrusts both hands' trills into the upper register of the instrument. The very first, single-line gesture of the piece is not given again until after the richly-varied ""recapitulation"" has been made; it arrives quite unexpectedly, and is punctuated by a falling fourth in the bass that ends on C natural—a pitch that, in his last music, assumes great significance for Scriabin, who came to view it as a kind of cleansing tonal focus. Like Scriabin's other sonatas, it is both technically and musically highly demanding for the pianist. A typical performance is about 12 minutes. Notable recorded performances of this piece include that of Scriabin’s son-in-law and musical champion, Vladimir Sofronitzky, and that of the great pianist Vladimir Horowitz, who also championed many of Scriabin’s works throughout his long career. The Russian virtuoso Arcadi Volodos took the very unusual step of opening his Carnegie Hall debut concert with this Sonata, reflecting a daring approach to programming as well as a commitment to Scriabin’s legacy. In 2018, Yuja Wang performed the Sonata in a recital tour, including Carnegie Hall and Berliner Philharmonie. The Berlin recital was recorded and released by Deutsche Grammophon as The Berlin Recital; the album received a Grammy Award nomination for ""Best Classical Instrumental Solo"".",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,Piano Sonata No. 2 (Scriabin),Scriabin,"Scriabin's Piano Sonata No. 2 in G-sharp minor, (Op. 19, also titled Sonata-Fantasy) took five years for him to write. It was finally published in 1898, at the urging of his publisher. The piece is in two movements, with a style combining Chopin-like Romanticism with an impressionistic touch. The piece is widely appreciated and is one of Scriabin's most popular pieces. The first movement Andante, in sonata form, begins with echoing effects, followed by two lyrically themed sections. The first theme is in G-Sharp minor, but the following two come in B major (the relative major). After a short climax in the development, the piece modulates to E major (also C-sharp minor) for the recapitulation and lyrical sections are restated with a slightly more complicated accompaniment. The second movement Presto, in sharp contrast to the first movement, is very fast and intense. Alternating crescendos and decrescendos may give the listener the impression of waves. The precedent of Beethoven's ""Moonlight"" Sonata allowed Scriabin the luxury of an opening slow movement to his Second Sonata, whose programme reads thus: ""The first section represents the quiet of a southern night on the seashore; the development is the dark agitation of the deep, deep sea. The E major middle section shows caressing moonlight coming up after the first darkness of night. The second movement represents the vast expanse of ocean in stormy agitation."" Typical of Scriabin's piano sonatas, it is technically and musically demanding for the pianist. A typical performance lasts about 11 minutes.",,,,,,,,

The work was commissioned by Jonathan Biss and the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra as the final installment in a project for five new compositions for piano and orchestra to be coupled with Beethoven's five piano concertos, and was premiered by Biss and the Swedish Radio Symphony under David Afkham in the Berwaldhallen on February 13, 2020, next to Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5. Beethoven's concerto is quoted in the work, and the orchestration is the same except for the addition of a percussionist and an alto flute. The three movements' titles quote remarks by Beethoven: # That sounds like a breaking axle – after his reaction after first hearing about Gneixendorf. # Difficult decisions. Must it be? – after annotations in his String Quartet No. 16's final movement. # Applause my friends, the comedy is over – after his alleged last utterance in his deathbed.

,,,,,,,,,,,Divertimento for Alto Saxophone,,"Kōmei Abe's Divertimento for Alto Saxophone was originally written in 1951 for alto saxophone and piano and subsequently orchestrated in 1960. It is a result of his interest in woodwind instruments in the postwar years, which led him to learn to play the clarinet in addition to his previous training as a cellist. His interest can be traced back to his schoolyears when he was moved by its use in Maurice Ravel's orchestration of Pictures at an Exhibition. The Divertimento is a lyrical and light-hearted work in the vein of French neoclassicism reflecting Abe's adscription to cosmopolitanism rather than to the primitivistic nationalism that was on the rise in Japanese music at the time. It consists of three movements, marked Andante sostenuto, Adagietto and Allegro lasting for about 20 minutes in total, and it was premiered by saxophonist Arata Sakaguchi. The orchestral version was first recorded by Aleksey Volkov and the Russian Philharmonic conducted by Dmitry Yablonsky in 2005. Following the release the Divertimento was rated as ""an enjoyable work, though not overly distinctive"" by Jonathan Woolf from Musicweb International, while Steve Hicken from Sequenza21 found that it showed to good effect Abe's ""straight-forwardly tonal, melodic, [...] lighter than air"" style and Uncle Dave Lewis from AllMusic praised it as ""sort of the kind of sax concerto that Richard Strauss might have written"", deserving to be added into the instrument's concert repertoire.",,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,Saxophone Sonata (Creston),Creston,"The Sonata for E Alto Saxophone and Piano, Op.19, was composed by Paul Creston in 1939. The sonata was commissioned in the spring by Creston's frequent collaborator, the American saxophonist Cecil Leeson. Creston began composition by June: it was completed by the end of August and slated for publication in 1940, although this was postponed to 1945 due to World War II. The sonata is in three movements and takes around thirteen minutes to perform. Its form follows a traditional, classical-era structure. The first movement is in a modified sonata form with no recapitulation: two themes are introduced in an exposition and extensively developed, before the movement ends with a coda. Harmonically, it is based on seventh chords, with its tonality moving between several tonal centers. A slower middle movement with song-like melodies follows, before the sonata ends with a rhythmically complex rondo featuring polymeters. The sonata as a whole is of considerable difficulty for both players. Creston and Leeson premiered the sonata at the Carnegie Chamber Hall on February 15, 1940, although Leeson had performed it on tour prior to that date. No critics were present at the premiere, but the sonata's 1955 debut recording by Vincent Abato and Creston obtained a mixed response. Most found the sonata enjoyable, but there was criticism of a perceived simplistic and salon-like styling. It was the first of Creston's chamber works to be recorded and had appeared on fourteen records by 1980. Today, it is broadly seen as a key piece of the classical saxophone's repertoire and is frequently performed.",Paul Creston,,,19,,,1939,3

It exists in several concert versions: for piano solo, piano and orchestra, two pianos and even six pianos with or without orchestra. The work consists of six variations on a theme, along with an introduction, connecting interludes and a finale. The theme is the ""suoni la tromba"" from Vincenzo Bellini's opera I puritani. Princess Cristina Trivulzio Belgiojoso conceived the piece in 1837 and persuaded Franz Liszt to assemble a set of variations of the march along with five of his pianist-friends. Liszt composed the introduction, second variation, connecting sections and finale, and integrated the piece into an artistic unity. Five well-known composer-performers each contributed one variation: Frédéric Chopin, Carl Czerny, Henri Herz, Johann Peter Pixis and Sigismond Thalberg. Princess Belgiojoso commissioned Hexaméron—the title refers to the Biblical six days of creation—for a benefit concert for the poor on 31 March 1837 at the princess's salon in Paris. The musicians did not complete the piece on time, but the concert was held as scheduled. The concert's highlight was a piano ""duel"" between Thalberg and Liszt for the title of ""greatest pianist in the world."" Princess Belgiojoso announced her diplomatic judgment: ""Thalberg is the first pianist in the world–Liszt is unique."" Hexaméron is divided into nine parts: # Introduction: Extremement lent (Liszt) # Tema: Allegro marziale (transcribed by Liszt) # Variation I: Ben marcato (Thalberg) # Variation II: Moderato (Liszt) # Variation III: di bravura (Pixis) - Ritornello (Liszt) # Variation IV: Legato e grazioso (Herz) # Variation V: Vivo e brillante (Czerny) - Fuocoso molto energico; Lento quasi recitativo (Liszt) # Variation VI: Largo (Chopin) - (coda) (Liszt) # Finale: Molto vivace quasi prestissimo (Liszt) Pianists Ingolf Wunder, Raymond Lewenthal, Leslie Howard, Francesco Nicolosi and Marc-André Hamelin, among others, have recorded the piece. Liszt made several versions of the piece: for piano and orchestra (S.365b) and for two pianos (S.654). It was also performed in a concert version for six pianos and orchestra. Pianists Ingolf Wunder, Leslie Howard and Eugene List recorded the orchestral version. In 2009, six New York–based composer-pianists—Matthew Cameron, Corbin Beisner, Simone Ferraresi, Quentin Kim, Greg Anderson, and Hwaen Chu'qi—created their own Hexameron Variations based on the same Bellini ""March"".

,,,,,,,,,,,"Piano Trio, Op. 11 (Beethoven)",Beethoven,"The Piano Trio in B-flat major, Op. 11, was composed by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1797 and published in Vienna the next year. It is one of a series of early chamber works, many involving woodwind instruments because of their popularity and novelty at the time. The trio is scored for piano, clarinet (or violin), and cello (sometimes replaced by bassoon). The key of B-flat major was probably chosen to facilitate fast passages in the B-flat clarinet, which had not yet benefited from the development of modern key systems (such as the Albert system or Boehm system). Beethoven dedicated this piano trio to Countess Maria Wilhelmine von Thun. The work is also sometimes known by the nickname ""Gassenhauer Trio"". This arose from its third movement which contains nine variations on a theme from the then popular dramma giocoso L'amor marinaro ossia Il corsaro (15 October 1797, Wiener Hoftheater) by Joseph Weigl. This particular melody, ""Pria ch'io l'impegno"" (""Before I go to work""), was so popular it could be heard in many of Vienna's lanes (""Gasse"" in German). A ""Gassenhauer"" usually denotes a (normally simple) tune that many people (in the Gassen) have taken up and sing or whistle for themselves, the tune as such having become rather independent from its compositional origins. A rare word in contemporary German, rough modern equivalents of the term include ""hit"" (success) or ""schlager"". Other composers who used this melody include Joseph von Eybler, Johann Nepomuk Hummel and Niccolò Paganini. Because of its unique scoring in Beethoven's output, there is some uncertainty as to whether to include it in the ordinal numbering of Beethoven's piano trios.

The work was copyrighted by the composer as the Concerto in C Major for Bassetti Accordion in 1968 and dedicated to Julio Giulietti (a leading promoter of the instrument in the United States ). The work is noteworthy in so far as it represents an attempt on the part of a known musician to complete a classical composition for an instrument for which relatively little classical music was written in America during the early 20th century. The score was premiered by a student of the composer (Joseph Nappi) during the American Accordionists Association's United States Championship Competition on Long Island, New York in 1964.

It was the first full concerto he wrote for the subscription concerts he gave in the city. The autograph is held by the Jagiellońska Library, Kraków with an additional, now incomplete, copy that Mozart brought to Salzburg in 1783, in the library of the Archabbey of St Peter's, Salzburg. The concerto is in the usual three movements: #Allegro in #Larghetto in (in B major) #Tempo di menuetto in It is scored for solo keyboard (piano or harpsichord), two oboes, two bassoons (second movement only), two horns and strings. The winds and brass do not play an important role throughout the concerto, and Mozart himself advertised an ""a quattro"" version, which is for string quartet and keyboard only, presumably for domestic use. As per 18th century performance practice a string orchestra could also have provided as a suitable option for the ""quattro"" accompaniment. The time signatures of the concerto are slightly unusual: Mozart wrote only three other keyboard concertos with first movements in (No. 4, K. 41, No. 14, K. 449 and No. 24, K. 491). In the first movement, Mozart definitively modulates to the dominant, C major, when he introduces the second subject in the prelude before returning to F major 8 bars later; a scheme also followed in No. 14.

The pieces, lively and full of national character, were well received at the time and today are considered among the composer's most memorable works, occasionally making appearances in popular culture. As described on Europeana, ""Contrary to what the title might suggest, the dances are not so much inspired by Slavic folk music generally, but specifically by styles and forms from Bohemia. In these pieces, Dvořák never actually quotes folk melodies, but evokes their style and spirit by using traditional rhythmic patterns and structures in keeping with traditional folk dances.""

Although these works were long considered to be original, they are now known to be pasticcios of sonatas by various German composers. The works on which the concertos are based were largely published in Paris, and presumably Mozart and his family became acquainted with them or their composers during their visit to Paris in 1763–64. By using movements from the sonatas of other composers, the young Mozart seems to have begun to learn how to cope with the structural problems of composing in the piano concerto form. It may be that Leopold Mozart had devised this as a compositional teaching method. If so, it seems that this may have been the first time this had been done by the composer. This is perhaps supported by two facts: First, Leopold excluded the first four concertos from his 1768 list, suggesting that he may not have considered them true compositions by his son. Second, the autographs of the four works are the joint products of both Mozart and Leopold (although K. 41 is mainly in Leopold's hand alone).",Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,plainlist,Köchel catalogue,,Concerto,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,Fantasia on Auld Lang Syne,,"The Fantasia on Auld Lang Syne is a piece for orchestra composed by the British light music composer Ernest Tomlinson in 1976. The original version was written for 16 saxophones. It was orchestrated in 1977 and there were later arrangements made for concert band and for ""two pianos and two turnovers"". The first version was commissioned by instrument maker Buffet Crampon as the finale for the 5th World Saxophone Congress, held at the Royal College of Music in July 1976. Tomlinson scored it for 16 saxophones in three groups: the (classical) London Saxophone Quartet; the (jazz) Peter Hughes Saxophone Quintet; and a third group including one each of the complete members of the saxophone family, from sopranino to contrabass. The first full orchestral performance was in March 1977 at the Palace Theatre in Manchester. The piece, lasting around 20 minutes, is a set of variations on Auld Lang Syne in the form of a quodlibet - a musical composition that combines several different melodies, usually popular tunes, in counterpoint, often in a light-hearted, humorous manner. The composer conceived it as an answer to Elgar's Enigma Variations, in which the original theme is never stated. Here Tomlinson introduces at least 129 well-known tunes, often overlapping, taken from classical and folk sources. Auld Lang Syne is always present as a counter melody. ""What is not generally known"", continues Tomlinson ""is that all other sets of important variations were also based on this song. Indeed, all the greatest tunes in musical history are based on Auld Lang Syne"". Morag Grant has pointed out that, hidden among extremely famous melodies such as the Toreador theme from Bizet's Carmen, Beethoven's Ode to Joy and the carol Good King Wenceslas, the piece also includes a 12-tone variation ""in distinctly Webernian style"".

,,,,,,,,,,,Five Pieces for Piano,,"Five Pieces for Piano, (German: ), Op. 23, is a set of five pieces for solo piano by Arnold Schoenberg, which he partly composed in 1920 and completed in 1923. The five pieces are: A typical performance of all five pieces takes around 12 minutes. Each of the pieces explores a different approach to serializing pitch. The first piece simultaneously unfolds series of 21, 20, and 13 pitches, which later recur in the same order, but changed in rhythm and octave to generate a different, contrasting musical texture. Its initial impetus was a June 1920 solicitation from Henry Prunières, editor of the French music magazine ""La Revue musicale,"" for contributions to a proposed ""Tombeau de Claude Debussy,"" although Schoenberg ultimately decided not to submit it for inclusion in that project. The brief second piece, also written in 1920, is strongly contrasting. The third, composed in 1923, is based on a motive of five notes, and the fourth, started in 1920, then resumed in 1923, features four recurring pitch constellations. Piece number five, the waltz, uses a series of all twelve equal-tempered pitches, although with no transpositions or inversions. It is sometimes described as the first 12-tone work, but Schoenberg wrote it in February 1923, and he had previously composed portions of the entirely 12-tone Suite for Piano as early as 1921. The Five Piano Pieces were first performed in their entirety in Autumn of 1923, in Hamburg, by Eduard Steuermann, who had also premiered the first two pieces in 1920, in Vienna.

,,,,,,,,,,,Piano Trio No. 43 (Haydn),Haydn,"Joseph Haydn's Piano Trio No. 43 in C major, Hob XV:27, was published in 1797 while Haydn was still in England on the second of his highly successful London visits. It is the first of a set of three trios dedicated to Mrs. Therese Jansen Bartolozzi. Batolozzi was an eminent pianist (a pupil of Muzio Clementi), and this trio is notable for its demanding piano part, at a time when the trio form was mostly associated with amateur performance. The trio is in three movements. The opening sonata form movement begins with a fanfare and maintains a classical elegance, with many pauses and delicate piano figuration, and a second subject that is derived from the first. The development section intensifies the mood with an almost baroque feel and moves into a false recapitulation in A and some energetic counterpoint, before the lyrical grace of the opening returns in the recapitulation proper. The violinist is asked to perform many embellishments, including double and triple stopping. In simple A-B-A form, the second movement begins with a gentle siciliano melody, which is restated before moving to a more dramatic A minor section, punctuated by heavy accents and featuring a more important role for the cello than is usual in Haydn trios. The final movement is one of a number of Haydn movements that use a hybrid of sonata and rondo form, blending the harmonic expectations and development of the sonata with a recurring refrain. It has a striking main theme, and was described by Charles Rosen as the most humorous of all Haydn's movements. The fast pace and drive of the opening is maintained through rapid conversational exchanges between piano and violin, indicating that the era of the trio as an accompanied piano sonata is drawing to a close.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,Piano Trio No. 45 (Haydn),Haydn,"(1791)]] Joseph Haydn's Piano Trio No. 45 in E major, Hob. XV:29, was published in 1797 but may have been written a few years earlier, while Haydn was still in England on the second of his highly successful London visits. It is the third piano trio of a set of three dedicated to the eminent pianist Therese Jansen Bartolozzi. It is the least technically sophisticated of the three in a set noted in general for their wide expressive range and virtuosity—piano trios at this time were typically written with amateur performers in mind. But it is still full of character and humour. The trio is in three movements. Instead of the expected strict sonata form, this march-like E major first movement is cast in A–B–A form, with the B section a version of the main theme in E minor, and the returning A section incorporating variations. There is an extended coda that leads into some remote modulations before a confident return to the home key. The second, brief movement in the key of B major with the theme first heard on the piano, then on violin, and then in canon. After a key change back to E, the music finishes in suspense on the dominant chord, making its function more of a long introduction to the third movement rather than a separate movement. Following without a break, this is a triple-time dance in the vernacular German style, using a ländler folk melody for its main material (as is made clear in the original title). Hints of gypsy fiddles and the hurdy gurdy alternate with more serious material.",,,,,,,,

The seven bagatelles are quite typical of Beethoven's early style, retaining many compositional features of the early Classical period. #The first bagatelle, which is in the key of E major, is perhaps the most well-known of the set. It is in ABA form. The A section starts with the right hand playing a soothing melody and the left hand accompanying it with broken chords.

This is typical of neo-Romantic composers such as Barber. As Susan Carter explains in her dissertation, ""The Piano Music of Samuel Barber"", that “neo-Romantic composers returned to a style characterized by broad lyricism and dramatic expression.” She also states that the traditional structures of form from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were conserved while drawing upon a “contemporary technical vocabulary.” From a boogie-woogie style of a five-part rondo to a theme and variations of a well known cowboy ballad, and even to a barn-yard dance with a fiddler, Barber uses each style effectively and accurately, according to the neo-Romantic ideas.

It was one of Chopin's first published compositions. The Polonaise was written between 20 and 28 October 1829 during a visit to the estate of Antoni Radziwiłł in Antonin. In a letter to Chopin's friend Tytus Woyciechowski, Chopin indicated that he wanted Princess Wanda, the daughter of Prince Antoni, to practice it. The Introduction was written in April 1830. The work was published in 1831 and dedicated to the Austrian cellist Joseph Merk. In a letter, Chopin wrote ""On Thursday there was a soiree at Fuchs’s, when Limmer introduced some of his own compositions for four violoncellos. Merk as usual made them more beautiful than they really were by his playing, which is so full of soul. He is the only violoncellist I really respect"". A typical performance lasts about eight and a half minutes, although the total performance time may vary. Due to the relative simplicity of the cello part, many cellists often heavily embellish the melody, sometimes to the point of complete distinction from the original melody. Jean Françaix orchestrated the work in 1951 in collaboration with Maurice Gendron. The score is published by Schott Music.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,Grand Duo concertant (Chopin and Franchomme),Chopin and Franchomme,"The Grand Duo concertant in E major, B. 70 is a composition for piano and cello, written jointly by Frédéric Chopin and Auguste Franchomme.

He had attended a performance and liked the work, but was disinclined to write a ""fantasia"" (as he put it in a letter to his family) on another composer's music. However, his friend Auguste Franchomme persuaded him to jointly write a piece for cello and piano, using themes from the opera. Chopin devised the general structure of the piece and wrote the piano part, with Franchomme writing the cello part. The piece was published under both their names, and was favourably reviewed by Robert Schumann. Chopin later dedicated his Cello Sonata in G minor to Franchomme, and they remained close friends until Chopin's death in 1849. The piece appears in catalogues of Chopin's works as B. 70.",,,,,,,,

Elgar was a young unmarried man of 27 when he met the ""Miss E. E."" of the dedication whilst on holiday in Scotland in the summer of 1884. It is notable that she shared his initials. He recorded four meetings with her in a diary, but did not reveal her name: the first meeting was on a loch boat to Oban, and the final meeting was at Inverness, with flowers from him before a last adieu. The work was composed when he returned home from the holiday. It seems appropriate and may be significant that the music contains the Scotch snap rhythm at the end of the principal subject.

It was originally intended to be used in Paul Whiteman's Experiment in Modern Music (which famously premiered George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue) concerts, but was deemed too radical. The original version was scored for a large orchestra. For convenience, Antheil reorchestrated the work in 1955 for a much more conservative ensemble, a version which also rids itself of the many dissonances and noises of the original. It was performed by the Harlem Symphonietta conducted by W.C. Handy, and was praised by the likes of Gershwin and Aaron Copland. Despite this critical success, it was overshadowed by the spectacle of the main work, Ballet Mécanique. The work can be seen with Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue and Darius Milhaud's La création du monde as one of the first classical works with a successful and overt jazz influence. Furthermore, while Gershwin's piece is more influenced by big band and swing, Milhaud's and Antheil's works can be seen as reinterpretations of the large freeness of Creole and New Orleans and cutting-edge New York jazz.",,,,,,,,

The Neue Mozart-Ausgabe points out that no French tune bearing the title ""Hélas, j'ai perdu mon amant"" ever existed. The melody also existed far earlier in France than Albanèse's version, since at least the sixteenth century. It is thought to have been written for Mozart's first piano student in Vienna, Marie Karoline, Countess Thiennes de Rumbeke (1755–1812), a cousin of Philipp von Cobenzl.",,,,,,,,

Anh. 56/315f by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is an unfinished work that was written in Mannheim in 1778. It was written for an Academie des Amateurs that was to take place in Mannheim. Mozart himself was to play the piano part and Ignaz Fränzl, the concertmaster of the Mannheim orchestra, was to play the solo violin part. Mozart only wrote the first 120 bars of the first movement, and only the first 74 bars are completely scored. Alfred Einstein believed that the work was abandoned due to the disbanding of the Mannheim orchestra; however, that had happened earlier that year when the Elector moved to Munich and most of his orchestra followed him, so the Academie des Amateurs replaced the Mannheim orchestra. The most likely explanation for the concerto being abandoned is that Mozart left Mannheim in December 1778, perhaps because the Academie did not start as early as he thought it would. It is unknown why he did not continue working on the concerto on his journey home or when he was back in Salzburg. In 1990 the British composer Philip Wilby reconstructed and completed the work for The Complete Mozart Edition. Its premiere recording took place in 1990 with violinist Iona Brown and pianist Howard Shelley with the Academy of St Martin in the Fields conducted by Neville Marriner, which was first issued as part of Volume 8 of The Complete Mozart Edition.

It is dedicated to the composer's friend August Iwański, at whose estate Ryżawka, and Józef Jaroszyński's manor in Zarudzie, the work was written. It lasts about 10 minutes in total. The Nocturne is in the key of B minor, having mainly long elegant lines soaring high above the piano accompaniment, but also sometimes diverts off the pathway into a Spanish idiom (Szymanowski had recently returned from a Mediterranean journey), and is alternately languid and febrile. The Tarantella is conversely in E minor, written a typically relentless Neapolitan 6/8 rhythm, with left-hand pizzicatos, double stopping and other effects. It was sketched during a single evening of drinking with Kochánski and Iwánski at Zarudzie. In 1937, Grzegorz Fitelberg arranged it for violin and orchestra. There is also a version for string quartet, arranged by Myroslav Skoryk. Nocturne and Tarantella has been recorded numerous times, first by Yehudi Menuhin and Marcel Gazelle in 1937, and subsequently by artists such as Ida Haendel and Adela Kotowska; Wanda Wiłkomirska and Tadeusz Chmielewski; and Krystian Zimerman; and ; Kyung-wha Chung, Ulf Hoelscher, Alina Ibragimova, Konstanty Andrzej Kulka, Johanna Martzy, Nathan Milstein and Aaron Rosand are other violinists who have recorded Nocturne and Tarantella.",,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,Piano Concerto (Tippett),Tippett,"British composer Michael Tippett composed his Concerto for Piano and Orchestra between 1953 and 1955 on a commission from the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. The overall character of the work was influenced by the composer's hearing German pianist Walter Gieseking rehearse Ludwig van Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto in 1950. Its musical content, while influenced by this concerto, was also shaped largely by Tippett's opera The Midsummer Marriage, which he had completed in 1952. While Tippett had conceived the work initially in the mid-1940s, he had been preoccupied in much of the intervening time with The Midsummer Marriage. The Piano Concerto was the result of one of Tippett's most complex creative cycles. The events that initiated the cycle contributed to its conceptual dimensions and date back to January 1950 when he was deep into the compositional process for The Midsummer Marriage. Echoes of the opera resonate throughout Concerto while two other previous compositions: the Fantasia on a Theme of Handel (1939–41) and the First Symphony (1944-5) figure prominently in the creative cycle as well. The Concerto was originally intended for Noel Mewton-Wood, who had assisted Tippett in playing back portions of the piano reduction of The Midsummer Marriage that were meticulously prepared by Michael Tillett, but Mewton-Wood killed himself on 5 December 1953. Further controversy over the concerto erupted when the soloist, Julius Katchen, declared the work unplayable and walked out shortly before its premiere in 1956. Katchen was replaced by Louis Kentner. With its emphasis on lyricism and poetry rather than high drama and virtuosic display, the Tippett piano concerto has been seen by British composer David Matthews as both commentary on and reaction against the percussive and heroic aspects that had predominated concerto writing in the decades preceding it. This approach was fully in keeping with the composer's stated disdain for what he considered a confrontational rather than collaborative approach to the genre. The work shows Tippett's predilection for incorporating innovative elements within a traditional formal structure. It follows the example of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto in having an expansive opening movement followed by two relatively brief ones. The harmonic basis for much of the piece, however, is built on musical fourths rather than thirds. These chords are treated as consonant, primary harmonies instead of their previously traditional role as dissonances that required resolution. This harmonic base supports a florid lyricism not far removed from The Midsummer Marriage.",,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,Trout Quintet,,"The Trout Quintet (Forellenquintett) is the popular name for the Piano Quintet in A major, D. 667, by Franz Schubert. The piano quintet was composed in 1819, when he was 22 years old; it was not published, however, until 1829, a year after his death. Rather than the usual piano quintet ensemble of piano and string quartet, the Trout Quintet is written for piano, violin, viola, cello and double bass. According to Schubert's friend Albert Stadler, it was modelled on an arrangement of Johann Nepomuk Hummel's then-popular Septet in D Minor for Flute, Oboe, Horn, Viola, Cello, Bass and Piano, Op. 74. That arrangement, using the same, somewhat unusual instrumentation chosen by Schubert, had been published in Vienna in about 1817, only a few years before the composition of the Trout Quintet. It may also have been influenced by Hummel's Quintet in E flat minor, Op. 87 .",Franz Schubert,A major,Schubert Thematic Catalogue,,,,,five}}
,,,,,,,,,,,Piano Quintet (Shostakovich),Shostakovich,"The Piano Quintet in G minor, Op. 57, is a five-movement composition for two violins, viola, cello, and piano by Dmitri Shostakovich. He composed it between July 13 and September 14, 1940. Sources conflict on where he began to compose it—the location is variously stated to be Shalovo, Kellomäki, or Moscow—but most agree that it was completed in Leningrad. It is the second of Shostakovich's two attempts at composing a piano quintet. His first dated from his student years, but was ultimately abandoned and repurposed in other compositions. A suggestion from the Beethoven Quartet over dinner in 1938 led to the creation of the Piano Quintet. Originally, Shostakovich had conceived the work as a string quartet. However, according to Isaak Glikman, an arts critic and close friend, Shostakovich modified the instrumentation because he hoped that demand for his performances as pianist would result in increased opportunities for personal travel. According to the musicologist Richard Taruskin, Shostakovich modeled his Piano Quintet, including its key and use of Baroque musical forms, on Sergei Taneyev's. Over the years, a number of small alterations to the score were made, which are documented in the two recordings of the work that Shostakovich made with the Beethoven Quartet in 1940 and 1955. The Piano Quintet's official premiere on November 23, 1940, at the Small Hall of the Moscow Conservatory was an immediate public success. Encores at this and subsequent concerts became so commonplace, that it quickly became a source of jokes for wags who referred to the work as a five-movement work with seven movements. Occasionally, audiences demanded encores of the entire work. Performances of the Piano Quintet took up so much of Shostakovich's time between late 1940 and mid-1941 that he had only enough time to compose a single work during that period. Opinions were more mixed among Shostakovich's professional colleagues. Sergei Prokofiev and Alexander Goldenweiser both were ambivalent about the music's merits, while the musicologist Daniel Zhitomirsky defended the work against detractors who had simplistic expectations from Soviet music. Even before the Piano Quintet's official premiere, it had been nominated for the inaugural Stalin Prize, along with works by Prokofiev, Nikolai Myaskovsky, and Aram Khachaturian. After three rounds of voting by the prize committee—as well as an unsuccessful last-minute personal appeal to Joseph Stalin from a disgruntled CPSU member who sought to deny the work a prize—the March 16, 1941 issue of Pravda announced that the Piano Quintet won in the first-class category. Its monetary award of 100,000 rubles attracted significant commentary from music critics in the United States after the work's stateside premiere in Carnegie Hall on April 29, 1941.",Dmitri Shostakovich,G minor,,57,,,,5
,,,,,,,,,,,Piano Concerto No. 17 (Mozart),Mozart,"The Piano Concerto No. 17 in G major, K. 453, was written in 1784 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The work is orchestrated for solo piano, flute, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns in G (and C for Andante), and strings. Like most of Mozart's concertos, it is in three movements: According to the date that the composer himself noted on the score, the concerto was completed on 12 April 1784. The date of the premiere is uncertain. In one view, the work is said to have been premiered by Mozart's student Barbara Ployer on June 13, 1784, at a concert to which Mozart had invited Giovanni Paisiello to hear both her and his new compositions, including also his recently written Quintet in E flat for Piano and Winds. Afterwards, Ployer was joined by Mozart in a performance of the Sonata for Two Pianos, K. 448. Another possibility, advanced by Lorenz (2006, 314), is that Mozart did not wait over two months to premiere the work, but performed it in his concert with Regina Strinasacchi on 29 April 1784 at the Kärntnertortheater. As a general consensus for researchers, it can be said with relative certainty that the work premiered during the mid-to-late spring of 1784, following its completion.

The second sonata is one of the most famous piano works in the repertoire and often called the Moonlight sonata, a contentious name not given by the composer himself. The first sonata remains far less performed than the second and the two sonatas are not commonly performed together. They are named so for their only loose adherence to the sonata form. The first movement of both sonatas are slow and lacking in full sonata form. The second movements are scherzos. The sonatas differ in structure in the third movement and only the first sonata has a fourth movement. In the first sonata, thematic material is referenced from one movement to the other which is also uncommon in a typical sonata of the time but more like the fantasia style. They were written in 1801.

From a musical family, she achieved early honours as a student at the Conservatoire de Paris but, believing that she had no particular talent as a composer, she gave up writing music and became a teacher. In that capacity, she influenced generations of young composers, especially those from the United States and other English-speaking countries. Among her students were many important composers, soloists, arrangers, and conductors, including Grażyna Bacewicz, Daniel Barenboim, Lennox Berkeley, İdil Biret, Elliott Carter, Aaron Copland, David Diamond, John Eliot Gardiner, Philip Glass, Roy Harris, Quincy Jones, Gilbert Levine, Dinu Lipatti, Igor Markevitch, Julia Perry, Astor Piazzolla, Laurence Rosenthal, and over 250 others. Boulanger taught in the U.S. and England, working with music academies including the Juilliard School, the Yehudi Menuhin School, the Longy School, the Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy of Music, but her principal base for most of her life was her family's flat in Paris, where she taught for most of the seven decades from the start of her career until her death at the age of 92.

It was the first piano piece ever written to be performed entirely free of the keyboard, using only manual manipulation of the strings within the instrument to produce sound via the flesh and nails of the finger. Cowell stated that his inspiration in creating the ""string piano"" method of playing came from a desire to reinvent the landscape of piano technique, finding new usages and sounds for old instruments without necessarily inventing new ones. In addition to the string piano method changing the technical execution of producing sound, performance of The Banshee also required the performer to play the instrument in a new orientation, standing in the crook of the piano perpendicular to the strings, rather than seated at a bench. This process of re-education was an intentional element of the piece, making conservatory-trained pianists re-assume the role of a new student, forced to individually pick out the notes on the strings to learn their placement. Due to this performance style, The Banshee was also a disruption of the contemporary expectations of piano recitals, intended to create discomfort for the audience as well as the pianist.",,,,,,,,

This movement ends with a coda marked ""Adagio"". # Scherzo (Allegro molto) (in D major and in ternary form) – The movement in the parallel key (tonic major) features flying notes, and a waltz-like middle section mainly in B-flat major. The movement is cheerful throughout. # Elegia (Adagio) (in G minor and in ternary form) – Following the cheerful scherzo comes the contrasting and sad slow movement in the subdominant minor. Presenting no formal grief but memorial thoughts, this movement is deeply elegiac but not funereal. The middle section begins in G major but involves a number of key modulations, which makes the passage that initially evokes a brighter mood even more affecting yet dreamlike later on. # Finale (Allegro non troppo) (in D minor and in rondo form) – Back in D minor, the movement opens dramatically. Later comes a recollection of themes from the third and first movements, which is followed by a turbulent ending that restates the primary theme of this movement. The trio is dedicated to the memory of the renowned Russian cellist, Karl Davydov.

The first public performance of the piece was in Washington, D.C., immediately prior to Obama taking the oath of office, when musicians Anthony McGill (clarinet), Itzhak Perlman (violin), Yo-Yo Ma (cello) and Gabriela Montero (piano) synced their performance to a tape they had recorded two days earlier. Obama officially became the 44th President of the United States while the piece was being performed, at noon, as the United States Constitution stipulates. Although it appeared that the piece was being performed live, it was in fact mimed while a recording made two days before was fed to the television pool and speakers. Yo-Yo Ma told NPR's All Things Considered that the piano keys had been decoupled from the hammers, and the bows of the stringed instruments had been soaped to silence them. The performers stated that the cold weather could have affected the tuning and durability of the instruments, making a live performance too risky. Williams based the piece on the familiar 19th century Shaker hymn ""Simple Gifts"" by Joseph Brackett. The source piece is famous for its appearance in Aaron Copland's ballet Appalachian Spring. The piece is slightly under 4.5 minutes. It is structured in roughly three parts. The ""Air"" melody at first intermingles with the ""Gifts"" theme, though it is supplanted by increasingly energetic variations. Midway through, the key shifts from A major to D major, in which the piece concludes. A short coda reprising the ""Air"" material follows the most vigorous of the ""Gifts"" variations. The piece concludes with an unusual series of cadences, ending with chord progression D-major followed by B-major, G-minor and finally D-major.

The second piano trio is more effervescent and cheerful in mood than the first trio – the composer himself said that it makes a ""friendlier and more immediate impression"" than its predecessor. Schumann's genius is heard in the way in which the first movement's relatively peaceful second subject sounds new and fresh, despite being a rhythmically altered version of the first subject. The intimately expressive second movement, in the key of D-flat major (the flattened submediant), opens with a sustained violin melody over an accompaniment consisting of cello and piano left hand in close strict canon. The waltz-like third movement, in B-flat minor, is also extensively built on canonic imitation. The material of the finale is largely built on the interplay between three contrasting elements in the first theme: a smoothly winding snatch of piano melody, a staccato answer in the cello, and a driving continuation in the violin.",,,,,,,,

The bottom being the BACH motif in retrograde: HCAB.]] Arnold Schoenberg's Suite for Piano (German: ), Op. 25, is a 12-tone piece for piano composed between 1921 and 1923. The work is the earliest in which Schoenberg employs a row of ""12 tones related only to one another"" in every movement: the earlier 5 Stücke, Op. 23 (1920–23) employs a 12-tone row only in the final waltz movement, and the Serenade, Op. 24, uses a single row in its central Sonnet. The basic tone row of the suite consists of the following pitches: E–F–G–D–G–E–A–D–B–C–A–B. In form and style, the work echoes many features of the Baroque suite. There are six movements: A typical performance of the entire suite takes around 16 minutes. In this work, Schoenberg employs transpositions and inversions of the row for the first time: the sets employed are P-0, I-0, P-6, I-6 and their retrogrades. Arnold Whittall has suggested that ""[t]he choice of transpositions at the sixth semitone—the tritone—may seem the consequence of a desire to hint at 'tonic-dominant' relationships, and the occurrence of the tritone G–D in all four sets is a hierarchical feature which Schoenberg exploits in several places"". The suite was first performed by Schoenberg's pupil Eduard Steuermann in Vienna on 25 February 1924. Steuermann made a commercial recording of the work in 1957. The first recording of the Suite for Piano to be released was made by Niels Viggo Bentzon some time before 1950. The Gavotte movement contains ""a parody of a baroque keyboard suite that involves the cryptogram of Bach's name as an important harmonic and melodic device and a related quotation of Schoenberg's Op. 19/vi.

Liszt had first met the Princess when he played in Kyiv on 14 February of that year. She was recently separated from her husband, and she invited Liszt to spend some time on her estate in Podolia. He stayed for 10 days, then left for a concert tour, promising to return in the autumn. He came back around 18 September, and stayed till early January 1848. It was during these three months that Liszt's and Sayn-Wittgenstein's relationship developed to the stage that she planned to petition the tsar, Alexander II of Russia, for divorce, and marry Liszt. During this time, Liszt also completed much of his Harmonies poétiques et religieuses. The suite has had few recordings.

Composed from 1947 to 1949, the sonata is in four movements. It was first performed by Vladimir Horowitz in December 1949 in Havana, Cuba, followed by performances in Washington, D.C. and New York City in January 1950. The sonata is regarded as a cornerstone of American piano literature and one of Barber's most significant achievements. Critics hailed it as a defining moment in mid-20th-century music, with The New York Times describing it as the ""first sonata truly to come of age by an American composer of this period"". Barber began composing the work in September 1947, completing the first movement later that year. However, progress was slow due to his demanding schedule, which included preparations for his ballet Medea and Knoxville: Summer of 1915. A planned retreat to the American Academy in Rome to focus on the sonata proved unproductive, as Barber was distracted by the postwar social scene and his interactions with intellectuals, Vatican insiders, and Italian culture. Barber returned to the United States in 1948 and completed the second movement by mid-August. Initially, Barber envisioned a three-movement work, but after sharing his progress with Horowitz, the pianist suggested a four-movement structure with a ""flashy last movement"". This advice led Barber to compose a virtuosic four-voice fugue as a final movement. Horowitz premiered the sonata in Havana, Cuba, on December 9, 1949. He followed this premiere with a private performance in New York in early January 1950 attended by prominent composers including Aaron Copland and Gian Carlo Menotti. The official US premiere took place at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., later that month, followed by a performance at New York's Carnegie Hall.

XV:26, was completed during the final few weeks of Haydn's second trip to London, and one of a set of three (H. XV:24–26) dedicated to Rebecca Schroeter. With its unusual key, this piano trio has been described by Robert Philip as ""subtle and shifting in its moods"". The trio is in three movements. The first movement begins quietly in its melancholy minor key, recalling Haydn's Sturm und Drang period of the 1770s, but it soon shifts to the major. The second movement, in F major, is an alternative scoring of the second movement of Haydn's Symphony No. 102 in B flat major. It is not clear which came first. The repeats in the trio are written out in the symphony, allowing for changes in the orchestration the second time through. The orchestral version also features a rolling triplet accompaniment in the cellos where in the trio the cello simply doubles the piano's bass line. Robert Philip comments that the ""delicately florid and rather improvisational style"" with its ""sudden shifts of key and atmosphere"" are more suited to the intimate setting of a trio, suggesting that this version may have come first. As with the Piano Trio No. 38 in D major (Hob. XV:24), the finale is in the style of a minuet, but tempered with melancholy and wistfulness. It is thought to have been the last movement Haydn wrote before leaving England for good in August 1795. The work was published in October 1795 by the English firm of Longman and Broderip as part of a set of three with the opus number (seldom used today) 73. The other two are No. 38 in D major (Hob. XV:24) and No. 39 in G major, (Hob. XV:25). All are dedicated to Haydn's friend, the widow Rebecca Schroeter.",,,,,,,,

Pan ** 'Pan' is named after the half-goat, half-man god of nature in Greek mythology, who is often depicted playing the flute, and after whom the panflute is named. The piece employs the Dorian mode (with flattened thirds and sevenths) that was used in ancient Greece. ** 'Pan' is dedicated to Marcel Moyse (the dedicatee of many other musical works). *2. Tityre :* 'Tityre' is named after the lucky shepherd in Virgil's 'Eclogues' (or 'Bucolics'). It is the shortest of the four pieces that together form a kind of sonatine, in which this piece plays to an extent the role of a scherzo. :* 'Tityre' is dedicated to Gaston Blanquart (1877–1962), a flutist who taught at the Conservatoire de Paris. *3. Krishna ** 'Krishna' is named after the Hindu god, probably particularly referring to the period in his youth as the divine herdsman, where Krishna played the flute, mesmerizing people and animals. Also in the music Roussel uses here a typical North-Indian musical scale ('Raga Shri', with flattened second and sixth, augmented fourth, perfect fifth, major third and seventh) from that region, that he visited in 1909. ** 'Krishna' is dedicated to Louis Fleury, to whom Claude Debussy dedicated Syrinx. *4. Monsieur de la Péjaudie ** 'Monsieur de la Péjaudie' is named after the protagonist of a novel by Henri de Régnier, 'La Pécheresse' (The Sinful Woman). M. de la Péjaudie is a fantastic flute-player but is more interested in playing women than the flute. Roussel earlier already had put some poems of Régnier, whom he highly regarded, on music. ** 'Monsieur de la Péjaudie' is dedicated to Philippe Gaubert, a flutist, conductor and composer who mainly wrote for the flute.",,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,Morpheus (Rebecca Clarke),Rebecca Clarke,"Morpheus is a composition for viola and piano by Rebecca Clarke, the English violist. It was written in 1917 when Clarke was pursuing a performing career in the United States. The piece shows off the impressionistic musical language Clarke had developed, modelled on the music of Claude Debussy and Ralph Vaughan Williams, that is also apparent in her Viola Sonata. The harmonies are ethereal and otherworldly; the title is the name of a Greek god, who was especially associated with sleep and dreams. Clarke gave the first performance of the work in a recital at the Aeolian Hall in New York City in February 1918, and subsequently performed it at Carnegie Hall in the spring of 1918 to great acclaim. She listed the work on the programme and signed the autograph score with the pen-name 'Anthony Trent'. Clarke was self-conscious about having a long list of pieces followed by her name in the composer's place. While the media had light praise for compositions bearing Clarke's name, it greatly applauded the work of the nonexistent 'Mr. Trent'. For Clarke, this only strengthened her belief that it was neither the time nor the place for female composers, though an essay by her from around the same time speaks of the fertility of the United States to produce a major composer, who happened to be a woman. Despite Clarke's insecurities, the piece survives—in two versions—into the modern day, and is an integral part of the violist's repertoire. The score is published by Oxford University Press.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,Romance for viola and piano (Vaughan Williams),Vaughan Williams,"The Romance for Viola and Piano was one of many pieces found in Ralph Vaughan Williams' library after his death in 1958. The date of the composition is not known, but it is thought to date from around 1914. It is probable that it was written for the great English violist, Lionel Tertis, the dedicatee of Vaughan Williams's other pieces for viola: Flos Campi (1925) and the Suite for viola and small orchestra (1933–1934), the latter of which was written for Tertis. The Romance is composed in arch form. It opens with soft, pentatonic murmurings from the piano, expanding into a rather melancholy and songful aria for the viola. The middle is somewhat restless and anguished, before closing in a similar manner to the beginning. The pentatonic modality is used throughout, though there are also stirring false relations and chromatic sections. The premiere took place at a New Macnaghten Concert on 19 January 1962 with Bernard Shore on viola and Eric Gritton on piano.

His relationship with Clara Wieck had reached a point of no return, as her father vehemently opposed anything that might interfere with his daughter's career as a pianist and strongly disapproved of Schumann as a possible son-in-law. Geographically yet not emotionally detached from Clara, he was able to communicate with her only through letters and in his own music.

The trio is in two movements, which were composed in reverse order: the second in 1795 and the first a year later: The long and contemplative first movement combines the features of variations and rondo. It is notable for its use of piano chords deep in the bass register, influenced by the sonorous English pianos Haydn came to appreciate while in London. This reads: Jacob's Dream! by Dr. Haydn. It refers to the biblical story of Jacob's Ladder ascending to heaven, as the movement features difficult passages in the upper register of the violin.

,,,,,,,,,,,Piano Trio No. 44 (Haydn),Haydn,"__NOTOC__ (1791)]] Joseph Haydn's Piano Trio No. 44 in E major, Hob. XV/28, was published in 1797 but may have been written a few years earlier while Haydn was still in England on the second of his highly successful London visits. It is the second of a set of three piano trios dedicated to the eminent pianist Therese Jansen Bartolozzi, and (like the others in the set) is noted for its especially wide expressive range as well as its virtuosity. The trio is in three movements: The first movement opens with an ascending theme presented, untypically, by the violin and cello in pizzicato; the effect is reminiscent of a harp. The piano answers with an ornamented legato version of the same theme, before all three instruments burst into a lively bridge section leading toward the dominant. The opening theme is reproduced in the development section in a rich, full-bodied version in A major. Set in the tonic minor, the second movement is in essence in the form of a passacaglia, being set to an ostinato bass, which is varied through the movement, though only subtly. Its creeping bass line is first introduced by all three instruments in unison, before the piano introduces a winding, ornamental melody over the top of it. Later, the melody and bass are used in invertible counterpoint. This movement has numerous features that link it with the second movement of J. S. Bach's Italian Concerto. The lively triple-time finale introduces a theme in short phrases, with a playfulness both in its rhythms and in its irregular length. The violin takes over in the minor-mode middle section, which includes an extraordinary modulation to E minor, while the return of the opening material is accompanied by changes in register, and the action is temporarily suspended by several diminished seventh chords before the music comes to a close.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,Piano Trio No. 42 (Haydn),Haydn,"(1791)]] Joseph Haydn's Piano Trio No. 42 in E major, Hob. XV/30 was completed in 1796 after his return to Vienna from England and first published there by Artaria in 1797. It is without a dedication: the piano part is less challenging than those trios dedicated to keyboard virtuosi. This is thought to have been Haydn's last piano trio and with a typical performance time of 20 minutes it is one of his largest. By the time of its publication, Beethoven had already published his first three piano trios (Op 1) setting a new direction for the form away from the 'accompanied piano sonata' towards a more equal and dramatic interplay between piano, violin, and cello.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,Maurice Ravel,,"Joseph Maurice Ravel (7 March 1875 – 28 December 1937) was a French composer, pianist and conductor. He is often associated with Impressionism along with his elder contemporary Claude Debussy, although both composers rejected the term. In the 1920s and 1930s Ravel was internationally regarded as France's greatest living composer. Born to a music-loving family, Ravel attended France's premier music college, the Paris Conservatoire; he was not well regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal. After leaving the conservatoire, Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity and incorporating elements of modernism, baroque, neoclassicism and, in his later works, jazz. He liked to experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, Boléro (1928), in which repetition takes the place of development. Renowned for his abilities in orchestration, Ravel made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' piano music, of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition is the best known. A slow and painstaking worker, Ravel composed fewer pieces than many of his contemporaries. Among his works to enter the repertoire are pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concertos, ballet music, two operas and eight song cycles; he wrote no symphonies or church music. Many of his works exist in two versions: first, a piano score and later an orchestration. Some of his piano music, such as Gaspard de la nuit (1908), is exceptionally difficult to play, and his complex orchestral works such as Daphnis et Chloé (1912) require skilful balance in performance. Ravel was among the first composers to recognise the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public. From the 1920s, despite limited technique as a pianist or conductor, he took part in recordings of several of his works; others were made under his supervision.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,Georges Bizet,,"(1875)]] Georges Bizet (; 25 October 18383&nbsp;June 1875) was a French composer of the Romantic era. Best known for his operas in a career cut short by his early death, Bizet achieved few successes before his final work, Carmen, which has become one of the most popular and frequently performed works in the entire opera repertoire. During a brilliant student career at the Conservatoire de Paris, Bizet won many prizes, including the prestigious Prix de Rome in 1857. He was recognised as an outstanding pianist, though he chose not to capitalise on this skill and rarely performed in public. Returning to Paris after almost three years in Italy, he found that the main Parisian opera theatres preferred the established classical repertoire to the works of newcomers. His keyboard and orchestral compositions were likewise largely ignored; as a result, his career stalled, and he earned his living mainly by arranging and transcribing the music of others. Restless for success, he began many theatrical projects during the 1860s, most of which were abandoned. Neither of his two operas that reached the stage in this time—Les pêcheurs de perles and La jolie fille de Perth—were immediately successful. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, during which Bizet served in the National Guard, he had little success with his one-act opera Djamileh, though an orchestral suite derived from his incidental music to Alphonse Daudet's play L'Arlésienne was instantly popular. The production of his final opera, Carmen, was delayed because of fears that its themes of betrayal and murder would offend audiences. After its premiere on 3 March 1875, Bizet was convinced that the work was a failure; he died of a heart attack three months later, unaware that it would prove a spectacular and enduring success. Bizet's marriage to Geneviève Halévy was intermittently happy and produced one son. After his death, his work, apart from Carmen, was generally neglected. Manuscripts were given away or lost, and published versions of his works were frequently revised and adapted by other hands. He founded no school and had no obvious disciples or successors. After years of neglect, his works began to be performed more frequently in the 20th century. Later commentators have acclaimed him as a composer of brilliance and originality whose premature death was a significant loss to French musical theatre.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,Piano Phase,,"Piano Phase is a minimalist composition by American composer Steve Reich, written in 1967 for two pianos (or piano and tape). It is one of his first attempts at applying his ""phasing"" technique, which he had previously used in the tape pieces It's Gonna Rain (1965) and Come Out (1966), to live performance. Reich further developed this technique in pieces like Violin Phase (also 1967), Phase Patterns (1970), and Drumming (1971).",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,Charles Gounod,,"]] Charles-François Gounod (; ; 17 June 181818 October 1893), usually known as Charles Gounod, was a French composer. He wrote twelve operas, of which the most popular has always been Faust (1859); his Roméo et Juliette (1867) also remains in the international repertoire. He composed a large amount of church music, many songs, and popular short pieces including his ""Ave Maria"" (an elaboration of a Bach piece) and ""Funeral March of a Marionette"". Born in Paris into an artistic and musical family, Gounod was a student at the Conservatoire de Paris and won France's most prestigious musical prize, the Prix de Rome. His studies took him to Italy, Austria and then Prussia, where he met Felix Mendelssohn, whose advocacy of the music of Bach was an early influence on him. He was deeply religious, and after his return to Paris, he briefly considered becoming a priest. He composed prolifically, writing church music, songs, orchestral music and operas. Gounod's career was disrupted by the Franco-Prussian War. He moved to England with his family for refuge from the Prussian advance on Paris in 1870. After peace was restored in 1871 his family returned to Paris but he remained in London, living in the house of an amateur singer, Georgina Weldon, who became the controlling figure in his life. After nearly three years he broke away from her and returned to his family in France. His absence, and the appearance of younger French composers, meant that he was no longer at the forefront of French musical life; although he remained a respected figure he was regarded as old-fashioned during his later years, and operatic success eluded him. He died at his house in Saint-Cloud, near Paris, at the age of 75. Few of Gounod's works remain in the regular international repertoire, but his influence on later French composers was considerable. In his music there is a strand of romantic sentiment that is continued in the operas of Jules Massenet and others; there is also a strand of classical restraint and elegance that influenced Gabriel Fauré. Claude Debussy wrote that Gounod represented the essential French sensibility of his time.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,Piano Quintet (Turina),Turina,"Joaquín Turina's Piano Quintet in G minor, Op. 1 was composed in 1907 at the age of 24 while he studied at the Schola Cantorum in Paris with Vincent d'Indy, and it was the composer's first published composition. It was premiered on 6 May that year in the Salle Aeolian by the Parent Quartet, to whose leader, Armand Parent, it was dedicated, while the first Spanish performance took place on 22 September in Sevilla. Ten days later the Quintet was awarded a prize in the Salon d'Automne by a jury composed of Bourgault-Ducoudray, Bruneau, Fauré, d'Indy, Magnard, Maus, Parent, and Pierné. The composition, lasting c.30 minutes, is inscribed in the Franckian tradition. It consists of four movements which do not follow strictly the traditional sonata scheme as Turina fuses the scherzo and slow movement and precedes the sonata-allegro with a slow fugue. The movements are marked in Spanish, French and Italian: #Fuga lenta #Animé #Andante — Scherzo #Final Turina didn't favour the Quintet's performance in later stages of his career as he considered it an impersonal work.

,,,,,,,,,,,Les Heures persanes,,"Les Heures persanes (English: The Persian Hours), Op. 65, is one of the most famous works of the French composer Charles Koechlin. It is based on the French novelist and traveller Pierre Loti’s Vers Ispahan, detailing his journey across Persia. Koechlin's hour-long work is a series of pieces - condensed into just two-and-a-half days - that captures and distils the scents and sounds of this faraway land. The Persian Hours includes 16 pieces for piano composed between 1913 and 1919. Koechlin prepared an orchestral version of the piece as well. The Persian Hours is a difficult work to record. It is an atmospheric work, mostly very slow and dreamy, and except for three or four movements (Travers les Rues; the mini-tone-poem Le Conteur; and the final Dervishes dans la nuit) is often extremely quiet. The orchestration is delicate and subtle, and it is entirely typical of Koechlin that although the piece is harmonically extremely audacious for its time (1913–19), the music is so subdued that its frequent polytonal or atonal basis might not be immediately apparent.",,,,,,,,

Ligeti had composed little since he completed his opera, Le Grand Macabre, in 1977, having only finished a few smaller pieces, like Hungarian Rock (chaconne) and Passacaglia ungherese for harpsichord. Influenced by sources as diverse as sub-Saharan African drumming, the music of Conlon Nancarrow, and the piano music of Chopin and Schumann, Ligeti wrote the Trio at the suggestion of pianist Eckart Besch as a companion to Johannes Brahms' Horn Trio, one of the few other examples in the genre, which is why the Ligeti Trio is marked Hommage à Brahms. Ligeti recalled his reaction to the suggestion: ""[a]s soon as he pronounced the word 'horn' somewhere inside my head I heard the sound of a horn as if coming from a distant forest in a fairy tale, just as in a poem by Eichendorff.""",György Ligeti,,,,,Horn trio,1982,Four
,,,,,,,,,,,Etudes Boreales,,"Etudes Boreales is a set of etudes for cello and/or piano composed by John Cage in 1978. The set is a small counterpart to Cage's other etude collections - Etudes Australes for piano and Freeman Etudes for violin. Etudes Boreales were composed for, and dedicated to, the cellist Jack Kirstein (1921-1996) and his wife, the pianist Jeanne Kirstein (1924-1979). The latter performed Cage's piano works in the 1970s, but found Etudes Boreales unplayable; the first performer to find a way to play the pieces was percussionist Michael Pugliese (Pritchett, 199). The set comprises four pieces. The cello parts are technically similar to Freeman Etudes: they are extremely demanding pieces composed using chance operations, every aspect of the work meticulously detailed in the score. The difference between the works is that in Etudes Boreales the pitch range is limited at any given time, and changes throughout the pieces, whereas in Freeman Etudes the range was unlimited. An excerpt from one of the etudes shows that the technique required involves the ability to jump accurately to any point on the fingerboard or beyond, which is particularly difficult in these pieces as they are to be played without vibrato (Stowell, 221): The piano parts of Etudes Boreales were composed using star charts, as in Atlas Eclipticalis, Etudes Australes and Song Books (here Cage chose the maps of Atlas Boreales, an atlas of the northern sky by Antonín Bečvář, hence the title of the work). However, the charts were used not to determine actual pitches, as in those works, but to determine where on the piano the performer is to play (the keyboard, the frame, the strings, etc.). This effectively transforms the piano etudes into percussion works (Pritchett, 199). Cello and piano parts may be performed separately, as Etudes Boreales for cello or Etudes Boreales for piano, or simultaneously as duets, although they were composed independently.",,,,,,,,

Ives intended to convey his idea of Ralph Waldo Emerson. The first version of the Sonata movement, completed around 1919 (although Ives stated in his ""Memos"" that it was actually ""finished"" in 1913), had many simplified passages, and omitted several passages that had been some of the ""Centrifugal Cadenzas"" of the Concerto (this version was published in 1921). These cadenza passages became ""Studies"" for piano. The passages that were retained in the Sonata movement that had been simplified were restored to their original state in the ""Four Transcriptions from 'Emerson that were assembled between 1915 and . When Ives recorded the Transcriptions in the 1930s, he restored most of these cadenza passages to the Transcriptions and one photostat copy of the Transcriptions (""Copy C"") shows how they were to be reinstated in writing (cf. the CD Ives Plays Ives for his recordings). Most of the more complex original text passages of the Sonata movement were restored to the Sonata in its second edition, in the 1940s. The Concerto was edited from all the extant sources: the existing Concerto sketches, the Sonata movement, the Studies, the Transcriptions, and verbal memoranda regarding the evolution of the music that Ives wrote as program notes to the Sonata movement. The manuscript sources for each have many verbal memoranda that refer back to the original idea of the Concerto, identifying materials for piano cadenzas, and for specific orchestral instruments. The ""viola part"" to the Sonata movement is not to be played by a viola. It is simply ""the viola part"" from the last page of the original Concerto sketch (where it is doubled by bassoon, and the downbeats to each triplet figure are doubled by tubular bells). When Ives added the line back to the Sonata movement (in the copy of the Transcriptions made by copyist Reiss), in both pencil sketch and ink patch, he simply called it ""viola part"". Ives never intended it to be played by a viola. This is not the same as the optional flute part in the ""Thoreau"" movement, where a flute player is explicitly called for.",,,,,,,,

Along with the famous Gymnopédies (1888) they are regarded as his first important works, and the ones upon which his reputation as a harmonic innovator and precursor of modern French music, beginning with Debussy, principally rests. The Sarabandes also played a key role in Satie's belated ""discovery"" by his country's musical establishment in the 1910s, setting the stage for what became his international fame. French composer and critic Alexis Roland-Manuel wrote in 1916 that the Sarabandes represented ""a milestone in the evolution of our music...pieces of an unprecedented harmonic technique, born of an entirely new aesthetic, which create a unique atmosphere, a sonorous magic of complete originality.""",,,,,,,,

It forms the first part of Diabelli's publication Vaterländischer Künstlerverein, the second part consisting of 50 variations by 50 other composers. It is often considered to be one of the greatest sets of variations for keyboard along with Bach's Goldberg Variations. The music writer Donald Tovey called it ""the greatest set of variations ever written"" and pianist Alfred Brendel has described it as ""the greatest of all piano works"". It also comprises, in the words of Hans von Bülow, ""a microcosm of Beethoven's art"". In Beethoven: The Last Decade 1817–1827, Martin Cooper writes, ""The variety of treatment is almost without parallel, so that the work represents a book of advanced studies in Beethoven's manner of expression and his use of the keyboard, as well as a monumental work in its own right"". In his Structural Functions of Harmony, Arnold Schoenberg writes that the Diabelli Variations ""in respect of its harmony, deserves to be called the most adventurous work by Beethoven"". Beethoven's approach to the theme is to take some of its smallest elements – the opening turn, the descending fourth and fifth, the repeated notes – and build upon them pieces of great imagination, power and subtlety. Alfred Brendel wrote, ""The theme has ceased to reign over its unruly offspring. Rather, the variations decide what the theme may have to offer them. Instead of being confirmed, adorned and glorified, it is improved, parodied, ridiculed, disclaimed, transfigured, mourned, stamped out and finally uplifted"". Beethoven does not seek variety by using key-changes, staying with Diabelli's C&nbsp;major for most of the set: among the first twenty-eight variations, he uses the tonic minor only once, in Variation 9. Then, nearing the conclusion, Beethoven uses C&nbsp;minor for Variations 29–31 and for Variation 32, a triple fugue, he switches to E&nbsp;major. Coming at this late point, after such a long period in C&nbsp;major, the key-change has an increased dramatic effect. At the end of the fugue, a culminating flourish consisting of a diminished seventh arpeggio is followed by a series of quiet chords punctuated by silences. These chords lead back to Diabelli's C&nbsp;major for Variation 33, a closing minuet.",Ludwig van Beethoven,C major,,120,,Variations (music),,34

This concerto is dedicated to his teacher, Eduard Marxsen.

,,,,,,,,,,,Piano Concerto (John Ireland),John Ireland,"The Piano Concerto in E-flat was John Ireland's only concerto. It was composed in 1930 and given its first performance on 2 October of that year by its dedicatee Helen Perkin at a Promenade Concert in the Queen's Hall. The work was an immediate success and was frequently performed by pianists such as Clifford Curzon, Moura Lympany, Eileen Joyce, Gina Bachauer and Arthur Rubinstein. While it is considered one of the best piano concertos ever written by an Englishman, it is not often heard nowadays and is not part of the standard repertoire. Encouraged by its success, Ireland planned to write a second concerto, but he only completed one movement, which he called Legend. This was also dedicated to Helen Perkin and she performed it for the first time on 12 January 1934, with the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Adrian Boult. and a disciple of George Gurdjieff, later marrying him and moving with him to Australia. As a result, Ireland withdrew the dedications of both works. Helen Perkin had played Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 3 at the Royal College of Music, and it is likely Ireland heard this performance and was influenced by the Russian's work. He had not, however, heard Ravel's G major Concerto since it did not appear until after Ireland's concerto was published. It is puzzling, therefore, that many commentators see echoes in Ireland's concerto not only of Prokofiev's concerto but also of Ravel's. In its jazzy rhythms, there are also hints of George Gershwin. The first person to record the Piano Concerto in E-flat was Eileen Joyce, in 1942, with the Hallé Orchestra under Leslie Heward. She was also the soloist when the concerto was played at a special Proms concert in 1949, to celebrate Ireland's 70th birthday (this performance was also recorded, and released commercially). After the concert, Eileen Joyce and her partner took Ireland to dinner, and Percy Grainger also attended. The concerto was again played at Ireland's 80th birthday concert. It has also been recorded by Eric Parkin (twice), Piers Lane, Kathryn Stott, Colin Horsley, Geoffrey Tozer, Mark Bebbington (as part of his complete John Ireland piano music edition) and John Lenehan. The Piano Concerto is in three movements, with the slow movement leading directly into the finale without a break. Ireland is said to have included a quotation from Helen Perkin's Phantasy String Quartet, which won a Cobbett Prize for composition earlier that year.

The composition presents scenes from the story rather than being a complete description of the tale. It was composed at a difficult time for Janáček, following the death of his daughter Olga and when he was still seeking musical recognition. Much of the music is in keys or modes with six flats, which gives the music a somewhat veiled quality similar to Janáček's piano work In the Mists.

It was written in Rio de Janeiro from 1921 to 1926 and is the largest and most challenging work Villa-Lobos wrote for the solo piano. It is in one continuous movement and runs about 19–20 minutes. The piece has been described (with license) as ""Le Sacre du printemps meets the Brazilian jungle"". For the title of this work, as he also did for other compositions, such as Vidapura and Momoprecoce, Villa-Lobos compounded two words together: rude, meaning ""rude"", ""coarse"", ""uncultured"", ""discourteous"", and poema, ""poem"". However, the score's dedicatee, Arthur Rubinstein, explained, ""The 'Rude' of the title did not have the English meaning. In Brazil it meant 'savage'. When I asked him if he considered me a savage pianist, he said excitedly, 'We are both savage! We don't care much for pedantic detail. I compose and you play, off the heart, making the music live, and this is what I hope I expressed in this work'"". Rudepoêma was later orchestrated by the composer, and premiered under his baton in Rio de Janeiro on July 15, 1942. The piece was intended as a tonal portrait of the Polish-American pianist Arthur Rubinstein, who premiered the work at the Salle Gaveau in Paris on 24 October 1927, on the first of a pair of concerts devoted to Villa-Lobos's compositions. The (Portuguese) dedication of the score to Rubinstein reads, ""My true friend, I do not know if I can have fully assimilated your soul with this Rudepoema [not italicised in the source], but I swear with all my heart that I have the impression in my mind of having recorded your temperament and of having mechanically transcribed it on paper, like an intimate Kodak. Therefore, if I have succeeded, you will be the true author of this work"". It is rhapsodic in style and elastic in its structure. It is filled with varied rhythms and dynamic tempo changes which are meant to portray Rubinstein's brilliant and varied personality. The two main themes of the work are presented at the outset, the first one in the bass register in the left hand, the second answering it in the right hand. Fragments of both themes are clearly audible throughout the composition, which reaches its climax only five bars from the end, with the right hand raining four fortissimo blows on three low notes, C, B, and A.",Heitor Villa-Lobos,,"W184, W310",,Solo Piano,,,1

The work was written at a time in Mozart's life when his preoccupation with the polyphonic techniques of the Baroque era had triggered a lasting creative crisis, forcing him to come to terms individually with his great idols Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel. The fantasy begins with an adagio tempo indication. The opening bars feature strong dynamic contrasts. (Forte in bar 1 suddenly changes to piano in bar 2). The opening adagio changes to andante eight bars later; at this point the right hand starts playing triplet semiquavers, whilst the left hand moves above the right hand for rising quaver arpeggios and then back down to play a descending dotted semiquaver in its normal position alternately. The tempo marking changes again, this time to piu adagio before a final tempo primo eight bars later. The fantasy ends in G major, the dominant of C major. The fugue is marked andante maestoso, which changes to adagio for the final two bars. It ends in the tonic key, C major.",,,,,,,,

Starting in the key of C minor, the piece is marked Adagio but then, after a section in D major, moves into an allegro section which goes from A minor to G minor, F major, and then F minor. It then moves into a fourth section in B major marked Andantino and then moves to a più allegro section starting in G minor and modulating through many keys before the opening theme returns in the original key of C minor. Most of the music is written with no sharps or flats in the key signature and uses accidentals—only the fourth section, in B major, is given a key signature. The autograph manuscript of this composition was auctioned by Sotheby's on 21 November 1990, and is now preserved in the International Mozarteum Foundation.

This was followed by the second movement based on a theme he had previously been saving for the right piece, and the first movement was created last. It is generally characterized by quirky rhythms combined with lyricism. The Sonata, marked by an impressionistic character and occasional elements of orientalism, is ultimately distinguished in its final, third movement by refined wit. American musicologist Jane Ellsworth describes it as a stylistically eclectic work, whereby the first movement has a little hint of Hindemith in it, the second movement is developed in a kind of patchwork between folk-like melody and two other therems, one a little Spanish-sounding, the other waltz-like, and the third movement closes the sonata with a catchy tune that ensures an enthusiastic audience response.",Bruno Vlahek,,Opus number,,,,2015,3

Alkan's innovation is also vividly present in the pieces. The 45th piece, Les Diablotins, features wrenched cluster chords and the 48th piece, En Songe, is a dreamy and quiet piece all except for the very final chord, which is a sudden F major chord with the dynamic ff. The 39th piece, Héraclite et Démocrite, features two sharply contrasting themes for the respective philosophers, and at some passages Alkan overlaps the themes to create a solemn and sad theme in the left hand and a bouncy and joyous theme in the right.",,,,,,,,

This sunny and tuneful piece manages to combine effective apparent pianistic pyrotechnics whilst keeping it within the range of ability of a keen student. The piece has three movements: *I. Allegro molto *II. Andante con moto *III. Presto The opening movement begins with a dramatic trumpet fanfare, followed by swirling piano writing that has a touch of the great piano concertos of Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov. There is a central dramatic cadenza before the opening theme returns, the movement ending with the same short fanfare. The second movement begins in G minor in a far more austere style, using pizzicato string notes over which a melody is played in octaves on the piano. There is a shimmering central section at a faster tempo that moves through various major keys before the opening minor theme is restated, but this time with a forte from the full orchestra. The opening quiet atmosphere eventually returns at the end of this movement. The final movement starts at breakneck speed, which is only briefly interrupted in the middle by a little march. Just before the end a sweeping romantic melody first heard in the first movement is played at full volume before the concerto ends with a prestissimo coda.

The theme is La Folia, which was not in fact composed by Arcangelo Corelli, but was used by him in 1700 as the basis for 23 variations in his Sonata for violin and continuo (violone or harpsichord) in D minor, Op. 5, No. 12. La Folia was popular as a basis for variations in Baroque music. Franz Liszt used the same theme in his Rhapsodie espagnole S. 254 (1863). Rachmaninoff dedicated the work to his friend the violinist Fritz Kreisler. He wrote to another friend, the composer Nikolai Medtner, on 21 December 1931: I've played the Variations about fifteen times, but of these fifteen performances only one was good. The others were sloppy. I can't play my own compositions! And it's so boring! Not once have I played these all in continuity. I was guided by the coughing of the audience. Whenever the coughing would increase, I would skip the next variation. Whenever there was no coughing, I would play them in proper order. In one concert, I don't remember where - some small town - the coughing was so violent that I played only ten variations (out of 20). My best record was set in New York, where I played 18 variations.

The sonata is structured like a typical Classical sonata, with fast movements surrounding a slower, more tender second movement. The movements feature sprawling themes and ambitious climaxes within their own structure, all the while building towards a prodigious culmination.

Although the ricercata (or ricercar) is an established contrapuntal style (which is used by the final movement of the work), Ligeti's title should probably be interpreted literally as ""researched music"" or ""sought music"". The work presages many of the more radical directions Ligeti would take in the future, exemplifying his intention 'to build a new music from nothing'. Nonetheless, the work refers explicitly to musical precedents: movement IV is given the indication 'Tempo di Valse', IX and XI pay hommage respectively to Bartók and Frescobaldi, and movements VI, VII, and VIII each employ conventional key signatures. In response to a request by the Jeney Quintet, six of the movements were arranged for wind quintet as Six Bagatelles for Wind Quintet (1953). They are, in order: III, V, VII, VIII, IX, X.

,,,,,,,,,,,Horn Trio (Brahms),Brahms,"The Horn Trio in E major, Op.&nbsp;40, by Johannes Brahms is a chamber piece in four movements written for natural horn, violin, and piano. Composed in 1865, the work commemorates the death of Brahms's mother, Christiane, earlier that year. However, it draws on a theme which Brahms had composed twelve years previously but did not publish at the time. The work was first performed in Zurich on November 28, 1865, and was published a year later in November 1866. The Horn Trio was the last chamber piece Brahms wrote for the next eight years. Brahms chose to write the work for natural horn rather than valve horn despite the fact that the valve horn was becoming more common. The timbre of the natural horn is more somber and melancholic than the valve horn and creates a much different mood. Brahms himself believed that the open tones of the natural horn had a fuller quality than those produced by valves. Nineteenth-century listeners associated the sound of the natural horn with nature and the calls of the hunt. Fittingly, Brahms once said that the opening theme of the first movement came to him while he was walking through the woods. Brahms also learned natural horn (as well as piano and cello) as a child, which may be another reason why he chose to write for these instruments following the death of his mother. Notwithstanding Brahms's love for the sound of the natural horn, he did specify that the horn part could be played by a cello and it was indeed published with a transposed cello part. Much later in 1884 Brahms also reworked the part for viola.",,,,,,,,

The sonata has four movements with the following tempo markings: # Allegro moderato # Andante molto # Alla Menuetto, ma poco più lento # Finale: Molto allegro A typical performance lasts around 20 minutes. In the first movement Grieg used a technique probably most famously used by Bach and Shostakovich: his own name, more precisely his initials E-H-G (H being the German name for note B), begins the melody in the first two bars, which is reiterated in octaves and even echoed by the left hand in bars 14 and 15. He used the same method in his two compositions of the Lyric Pieces: ""Gade"", Op. 57, No. 2 and ""Secret"", Op. 57, No. 4, using the name of his admired colleague Gade.

It was dedicated to Natalya Sekerina, the sweetheart of his adolescence. The opening Andante gives way to a more agitated sonata movement. The cadence theme, especially on its return where it is accompanied by simple chords rather than flowing accompaniment figures, has a touch of a mazurka about it. The development section, with its broken tenths in the left hand and the polyphony in the treble, is very original in its sonorities. The end introduces a reminiscence of an ensuing idea in the introduction. Its chromaticism is highly characteristic of Scriabin's later works. It was written during the time when Scriabin was studying under Nikolai Zverev.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,Fantaisie in B minor (Scriabin),Scriabin,"Alexander Scriabin's Fantasie in B minor, Op. 28, was written in 1900. This is a single sonata form movement which bridges the gap between Scriabin's third and his fourth sonata. Scriabin wrote this piece during an otherwise compositionally unproductive period during his tenure at the Moscow Conservatory. The first edition was published by Belaieff. The piece's existence may have been forgotten by the composer. According to Leonid Sabaneyev, when Sabaneev started to play one of its themes on the piano in Scriabin's Moscow flat (now a museum), Scriabin called out from the next room ""Who wrote that? It sounds familiar."" – ""Your 'Fantaisie, was the reply. Scriabin said, ""What 'Fantaisie'?"" This story, told by Sabaneev and repeated by Faubion Bowers in his biography of Scriabin, may however be apocryphal. At any rate, as Sabaneev saw fit to fake Scriabin's death-date and otherwise make free with facts, his recountings of otherwise uncorroborated stories are best taken with a grain of salt. Be that as it may, Bowers' extensive documentation of Scriabin's concert programs shows no evidence of Scriabin having played the piece in public. The Fantasy begins with ambiguous, open harmony not unlike that which Scriabin used for the opening of his second sonata, known as the Sonata-Fantasy. The opening is clearly in B minor, but the tonic is consistently avoided: a technique used extensively in Chopin's ballades, in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde, and by Scriabin himself in his third and fourth sonatas. The opening is characterized by an inexorably descending bassline and a melody that alternately struggles upwards and plunges dramatically back down in jagged gestures. This brooding opening gives way to one of Scriabin's most beautiful melodies, a second subject in D major. The melody is treated canonically, with multiple voices echoing above an extremely widespread left-hand accompaniment. The closing groups, also in D major, are grand and confident with rhythmic obsessiveness and directional gestures characteristic of Scriabin's heroic writing. In the recapitulation, the first subject is extensively elaborated with sweeping arpeggios in both hands. It is, however, truncated, giving way quite rapidly to a transition to the second theme. The second subject, meanwhile, is recapitulated in grandeur rather than tenderness: an apotheosis not unlike the thematic transformation of the main subject in Chopin's first ballade from its initial tender statement in E♭ major to its grand exuberance in A major. Despite the implications of freedom and improvisation entailed in the title ""Fantasy"", the work is really a rather straightforward (if not formulaic) sonata-allegro. Its exposition has a clear first subject and transition, followed by a second subject and closing groups in the relative major. The development section is characteristically stormy, sequencing motives from the exposition; and except for the truncation of the first theme the recapitulation maps measure for measure onto the exposition. The ""Fantasy"" elements take over, however, at the end of the recapitulation: rather than settling comfortably into B major, the piece launches into a coda that is at turns free and improvisational, sequential (almost a second development), and recapitulatory. (See for comparison the fourth movement of Scriabin's Sonata No. 3, which seems to be on ambiguous formal borderline between sonata-allegro and sonata-rondo.) Ultimately the coda ends triumphantly in B major, with a strong evocation of Wagner's ""Liebestod"". At any rate, the texture at the close is very similar to that of Liszt's transcription of the Wagner; the key is the same; and in each case the major tonic is approached by the supertonic half diminished seventh chord. The Fantasy contains some of Scriabin's most difficult writing before his late period. The dense and contrapuntal textures are extremely difficult to voice, the collisions between the hands require careful working out, and the left-hand accompaniment is in places more or less impossible (requiring redistribution).",,,,,,,,

Unlike the preceding three scherzi (Op. 20, Op. 31, Op. 39), the E-major is generally calmer in temperament, though it still possesses some exceptionally passionate and dramatic moments. It seems to be a work that divides opinion: for pianist Jack Gibbons the 4th scherzo ""is one of Chopin's most elegiac works, and without doubt contains some of the most profound and introspective music the composer ever wrote"" while for John Palmer the work exhibits ""more capriciousness and elegance than profundity."" Petazzi said this scherzo differs from the others ""as if it had passed through a magically purifying expressive filter."" The scherzo is in sonata rondo form, with a trio in C-sharp minor. It is the only one of Chopin's four scherzos primarily in a major key. As one critic explains, ""When Chopin is at his happiest, most outwardly serene, then, for the pianist, he is at his most treacherous. The Fourth Scherzo is the only one in a major key and its mercurial brilliance and whimsy are notoriously hard to control."" Saint-Saëns particularly liked this scherzo.",,,,,,,,

Weber most likely composed the work for himself (on piano) and his friend Heinrich Baermann, a leading clarinettist of the era, although it has also been suggested that the intended clarinettist was Johann Simon Hermstedt. The three movements are as follows: #Allegro con fuoco #Andante con moto #Rondo: allegro The second and third movements were completed before the first and were probably performed in 1815 for King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria at the Nymphenburg Palace. During its composition, Weber designated the work as a sonata, but abandoned that title upon its completion. This decision reflected the work's character as more of a showcase for two virtuosos than a conventionally structured and integrated work. The first movement is in sonata form, the second movement is an Andante in C minor, and the finale is a lilting rondo in E-flat major. The British music critic John Warrack suggests the work could be referred to as a ""double concerto without orchestra"", reflecting the highly virtuosic roles for both performers.

Both trios were composed during Beethoven's stay at Countess Marie von Erdödy's estate, and both are dedicated to her for her hospitality. They were published in 1809. The first, in D major, known as the Ghost, is one of his best known works in the genre (rivaled only by the Archduke Trio). The D major trio features themes found in the second movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 2. The All-Music Guide states that ""because of its strangely scored and undeniably eerie-sounding slow movement, it was dubbed the 'Ghost' Trio. The name has stuck with the work ever since. The ghostly music may have had its roots in sketches for a Macbeth opera that Beethoven was contemplating at the time."" According to Lewis Lockwood, Beethoven's pupil Carl Czerny wrote in 1842 that the slow movement reminded him (Czerny) of the ghost scene at the opening of Shakespeare's Hamlet, and this was the origin of the nickname. James Keller also attributes the nickname to Czerny, adding, ""You may discard as erroneous the oft-encountered claim that this movement of the Ghost Trio is a reworking of music Beethoven originally sketched as the Witches Chorus for his Macbeth. These pieces are representative of Beethoven's ""Middle"" stylistic period, which went from roughly 1803 to 1812, and which included many of his most famous works. Beethoven wrote the two piano trios while spending the summer of 1808 back once again in Heiligenstadt, Vienna, where he had completed his Symphony No. 5 the previous summer. He wrote the two trios immediately after finishing his Sinfonia pastorale, Symphony No. 6. This was a period of uncertainty in Beethoven's life, in particular because he had no dependable source of income at the time. Although these two trios are sometimes numbered as ""No. 5"" and ""No. 6"", the numbering of Beethoven's twelve piano trios is not standardized, and in other sources the two Op. 70 trios may be shown as having different numbers, if any.",,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,Claude Debussy,,"Achille Claude Debussy (; 22 August 1862&nbsp;– 25 March 1918) was a French composer. He is sometimes seen as the first Impressionist composer, although he vigorously rejected the term. He was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Born to a family of modest means and little cultural involvement, Debussy showed enough musical talent to be admitted at the age of ten to France's leading music college, the Conservatoire de Paris. He originally studied the piano, but found his vocation in innovative composition, despite the disapproval of the Conservatoire's conservative professors. He took many years to develop his mature style, and was nearly 40 when he achieved international fame in 1902 with the only opera he completed, Pelléas et Mélisande. Debussy's orchestral works include Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune (1894), Nocturnes (1897–1899) and Images (1905–1912). His music was to a considerable extent a reaction against Wagner and the German musical tradition. He regarded the classical symphony as obsolete and sought an alternative in his ""symphonic sketches"", La mer (1903–1905). His piano works include sets of 24 Préludes and 12 Études. Throughout his career he wrote mélodies based on a wide variety of poetry, including his own. He was greatly influenced by the Symbolist poetic movement of the later 19th century. A small number of works, including the early La Damoiselle élue and the late Le Martyre de saint Sébastien have important parts for chorus. In his final years, he focused on chamber music, completing three of six planned sonatas for different combinations of instruments. With early influences including Russian and Far Eastern music and works by Chopin, Debussy developed his own style of harmony and orchestral colouring, derided – and unsuccessfully resisted – by much of the musical establishment of the day. His works have strongly influenced a wide range of composers including Béla Bartók, Igor Stravinsky, George Gershwin, Olivier Messiaen, George Benjamin, and the jazz pianist and composer Bill Evans. Debussy died from cancer at his home in Paris at the age of 55 after a composing career of a little more than 30 years.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,Zigeunerweisen,,"Zigeunerweisen (Gypsy Airs, ), Op. 20, is a musical composition for violin and orchestra written in 1878 by the Spanish composer Pablo de Sarasate. It was premiered the same year in Leipzig, Germany. Like his contemporaries, Sarasate misidentified Hungarian folk music with the ""gypsy music"" of the Romani people, and the themes in the piece are not of Romani origin, but were all actually adapted from Hungarian music pieces: for instance, the third section borrows a melody by Hungarian composer (1836–1908), and the last section uses a theme from Franz Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 13, in the rhythm of the csárdás. As one of Sarasate's most popular compositions and a favorite among violin virtuosos, the work has remained a staple on records at least since Sarasate himself recorded it in 1904, in collaboration with fellow composer Juan Manén as the accompanying pianist in the aforementioned recording, although the 3rd movement was omitted due to time constraints of records. Sarasate's voice is briefly heard in the middle of the record. Before the 4th movement, the following sentence can be heard: ""Baja el pedal de la sordina."" (""Lower the damper pedal."") It has been recorded by a large number of violinists.",Pablo de Sarasate,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,Eroica Variations,,", c. 1803]] The Variations and Fugue for Piano in E major, Op. 35 are a set of fifteen variations (plus three ""bonus"" variations) for solo piano composed by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1802. They are commonly referred to as the Eroica Variations because a different set of variations on the opening bass line section were used as the finale of his Symphony No. 3 Eroica composed the following year. Musicologists Leon Plantinga and Alexander Ringer claim that the inspiration for the Eroica theme may have come from Classical era composer Muzio Clementi. Plantinga theorizes that a source may be Clementi's Piano Sonata in F minor, Op. 13, No. 6 (composed in 1784), where the first seven or eight notes of the Eroica theme can be matched, with a simpler rhythm, with the beginning of the third movement (in a minor key), and later to the melody in a major key (the Eroica theme is in a major key, although there are variations in minor keys). Ringer points to the first movement of the Piano Sonata in G minor, Op. 7, No. 3 (composed in 1782) as a possible source, where the melody (in a minor key) and rhythm closely match the first eight bars of the Eroica theme (a major version also exists in the movement, matching very closely the melody in the major key from the F minor, Op. 13, No. 6 sonata). The theme was a favourite of Beethoven's. He had used it in the finale of the ballet music he composed for The Creatures of Prometheus (1801), as well as for the seventh of his 12 Contredanses, WoO 14 (1800-02), before being the subject of the variations of this work and of the later symphony. It begins thus: : In a departure from the classical theme-and-variations form, Beethoven opens the work not with the main theme, but the bass line to the main theme. He then follows with three variations of this bass line before finally stating the main theme. This approach was carried over from the ballet music, where it represented the gradual creation of life forms by Prometheus. The variations in the Eroica Symphony follow this same pattern. In another departure from traditional variation form, after the fifteen variations of the main theme, Beethoven finishes the work with a finale consisting of a fugal variation followed by two more variations marked Andante con moto.",,,,,,,,

The original manuscript has not survived and the final measures of the piece have been lost or were never completed by Mozart. The ending as it currently exists (the last 10 measures) is believed to have been written by August Eberhard Müller, one of the composer's admirers.

In performance it lasts about 5 minutes. Satie biographer Rollo H.

,,,,,,,,,,,Swipesy Cakewalk,,"The ""Swipesy Cakewalk"" is a ragtime composition published in 1900 by a musical duo consisting of Scott Joplin, who likely composed the trio, and the young composer Arthur Marshall, who most probably composed the rest of the piece with oversight from Joplin. ""Swipesy"" uses the simple syncopations of a cakewalk - the first beat being a sixteenth, eighth, sixteenth note division, and the second beat an even eighth note division. The style follows the AA BB A CC DD musical form common for both cakewalks and rags, particularly after the earlier publication of Joplin's hit ""Maple Leaf Rag"". Although called a cakewalk, it departs from the cakewalk form in favor of the more standard ragtime idiom at various points, most notably throughout the C (Trio) section. A popular legend says that the title was suggested by John Stillwell Stark, one of Joplin's original publishers, when ""Swipesy"" was first being considered for publication. The photograph which was to appear on the cover of the new (and unnamed) composition featured a young Sedalia newsboy with a shy expression on his face. Stark allegedly remarked that the boy's countenance seemed to suggest that he had just ""swiped"" something from a cookie jar. ""Lets call [the tune] 'Swipesy',"" said Stark, and thus the title was decided. Marshall gave another explanation of the title's origin during a 1960 interview: he and Joplin had just delivered the music to Stark's office when two newspaper boys began quarreling outside, one swiped a newspaper from the other, and Stark, upon observing this, suggested that they name the work ""Swipesy"".

,,,,,,,,,,,Barcarolle (Chopin),Chopin,"The Barcarolle in F-sharp major, Op. 60, is a piece for solo piano by Frédéric Chopin, composed between autumn of 1845 and summer 1846, three years before his death. Based on the barcarolle rhythm and mood, it features a sweepingly romantic and slightly wistful tone. Many of the technical figures for the right hand are thirds and sixths, while the left features very long reaches over an octave. Its middle section is in A major, and this section's second theme is recapitulated near the piece's end in F-sharp. It is also one of the pieces where Chopin's affinity to the bel canto operatic style is most apparent, as the double notes in the right hand along with spare arpeggiated accompaniment in the left hand explicitly imitates the style of the great arias and scenas from the bel canto operatic repertoire. The writing for the right hand becomes increasingly florid as multiple lines spin filigree and ornamentation around each other. This is one of Chopin's last major compositions, along with his Polonaise-Fantasie, Op. 61. It is often considered to be one of his more demanding compositions, both in execution and interpretation, and recordings exist by virtually all the greatest pianists.

Sposalizio is the title of the first piece in Franz Liszt's Deuxième Année de Pèlerinage: Italie (Second Year of Pilgrimage: Italy), published in 1858. The composition starts out with a simple pentatonic melody, described as a ""bell-like motif"", which transforms itself into a complex musical architecture. The melody then transforms itself into a type of wedding march, which continually embellishes itself to lead up to the grand climax, which contains crashing octaves into a loud finish. The composition ends quietly. Liszt composed ""Sposalizio"", which translates as ""Marriage"", from Italian, after being inspired by Raphael's painting The Marriage of the Virgin. Most of the works contained in the Italy series of Années de Pèlerinage have titles derived from works of art with a connection to Italy.

It was first published by the composer in 1803 and served as an illustration of a nouveau système (Fr. ""new system"") Reicha invented for fugue composition. This system involved, among other things, extensive use of polyrhythms, derived from traditional music, and fugal answers on any and all scale degrees, rather than just the dominant, which was standard at the time.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,Tristan (Henze),Henze,"Tristan is a six-movement orchestral work by the German composer Hans Werner Henze. Scored for piano, tape and full orchestra, its form is innovative for an instrumental concert: solo pieces for piano (""preludes"") alternate with orchestral passages, which are played partly without, partly with the participation of the piano. It takes the form of a homage to Richard Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde, with the piano providing preludes to a series of widely divergent material, both live and on tape, including direct quotations from Brahms's First Symphony and Chopin's Funeral March, a birdsong-like treatment on tape of a recording of a soloist singing Isolde's part and a child reading extracts from Hilaire Belloc's English translation of Joseph Bédier's account of the death of Isolde, as well as a recording of a human heartbeat. Henze was both attracted to and repelled by aspects of 19th century culture, and so the passages of Wagner, Chopin and Brahms represent musical romanticism, which can be described in terms of progress, virtuosity and historicism. The tape has its own system in the score, which indicates the actual sound by means of graphic lines. The twelve-tone-set c#-d-a-d#-e-h-f-a#-f#-g#-c-g can be traced back to the three-tone constellation of major-third and minor-second, which also determine the first three notes of Richard Wagner's ""Tristan and Isolde"" (a-f-e). Commissioned by the London Symphony Orchestra, it was premiered on 20 October 1974 under Colin Davis at the Royal Festival Hall in London. The piano soloist was Homero Francesch, who later recorded it with the composer conducting. The six movements are: *Prologue *Lament *Prelude and Variations *Tristan's Folly *Adagio *Epilogue",,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,Schubert's last sonatas,,", of Schubert at the end of his life]] Franz Schubert's last three piano sonatas, 958, 959 and 960, are his last major compositions for solo piano. They were written during the last months of his life, between the spring and autumn of 1828, but were not published until about ten years after his death, in 1838–39. Like the rest of Schubert's piano sonatas, they were mostly neglected in the 19th century. By the late 20th century, however, public and critical opinion had changed, and these sonatas are now considered among the most important of the composer's mature masterpieces. They are part of the core piano repertoire, appearing regularly on concert programs and recordings. One of the reasons for the long period of neglect of Schubert's piano sonatas seems to be their dismissal as structurally and dramatically inferior to the sonatas of Beethoven. In fact, the last sonatas contain distinct allusions and similarities to works by Beethoven, a composer Schubert venerated. Nevertheless, musicological analysis has shown that they maintain a mature, individual style. The last sonatas are now praised for that mature style, manifested in unique features such as a cyclical formal and tonal design, chamber music textures, and a rare depth of emotional expression. Each one of the three sonatas is cyclically intraconnected by diverse structural, harmonic and melodic elements tying together all movements, as well as interconnecting all three sonatas together. Consequently, they are often regarded as a trilogy. They also contain specific allusions and similarities to other Schubert compositions, such as his Winterreise song cycle; these connections point to turbulent emotions expressed in the sonatas, often understood as highly personal and autobiographical. Indeed, some researchers have suggested specific psychological narratives for the sonatas, based on historical evidence concerning the composer's life.",,,,,,,,

In response to frequent criticisms of prepared piano, Cage cited numerous predecessors (such as Henry Cowell). In the liner notes for the very first recording of his most highly acclaimed work for prepared piano, Sonatas and Interludes, Cage wrote: ""Composing for the prepared piano is not a criticism of the instrument. I'm only being practical."" This article presents a complete list of Cage's works for prepared piano, with comments on each composition.

The first version appears in Liszt's set Album d'un voyageur (1834–1838), and the second in the first suite of Liszt's Années de pèlerinage (1836–1855). The last version is almost identical to the second, except for the final nine bars, which were added by Liszt as a coda for his Italian piano student Giovanni Sgambati, who was also a composer; this lengthened the piece by about 30 seconds. The coda was written in 1863. The second version of Au bord d'une source is often regarded as the most popular.

It is dedicated to Hungarian virtuoso violinist Joseph Szigeti, a close friend of Bartók, who gave the first performance of the orchestra version in Königsberg on 1 November 1929, with Hermann Scherchen conducting the orchestra. Bartók evidently composed both rhapsodies purely as a personal gesture, rather than on commission, and did so without telling anyone until they were both completed. According to the violinist Zoltán Székely, he and the composer met one day in 1928 and, after chatting for a time, Bartók suddenly announced that he had a surprise for him, and produced the manuscripts of the two rhapsodies, which no one else had previously seen. ""One is for you; one is for Szigeti,"" Bartók told him. ""You may choose which one you like for the dedication."" Székely chose the Second Rhapsody, but quickly added, ""that doesn't mean that the First Rhapsody was already dedicated to Szigeti!"". Both rhapsodies exemplify a mode of composition using peasant-music sources, described by Bartók as taking an existing melody and adding an accompaniment together with some introductory or ending material, in such a way that the newly composed matter is strictly secondary—never competing with the folk material for prominence. This was acknowledged in the scores of the early editions, which bore the subtitle ""Folk Dances"". Bartók's objective was to transplant the entire style of Eastern-European fiddle playing into the Western concert context. In order to further this project, he insisted that Szigeti listen to the original field recordings from which the melodies were transcribed. The Rhapsody uses the same slow–fast (lassú—friss) paired movements of the popular Hungarian verbunkos (recruiting dance) found in the earlier Rhapsody for Piano of 1904, and to which he would later return in the first movement of Contrasts in 1938.

It started out as a piece for cello and piano, written in collaboration between Mompou and the cellist Gaspar Cassadó. Work on this version of the piece started in 1938, but was abandoned. Mompou then published four variations for solo piano, but with the incongruous title Three Variations. Kenneth MacMillan's ballet La Casa de los Pájaros (The House of Birds), set to orchestrations by John Lanchbery of various piano pieces by Mompou, had been premiered at Sadler's Wells in London in 1955, and was also staged at the 4th Festival de Música y Danza at Granada. Mompou was then asked by The Royal Ballet, London to write another ballet in the hope of emulating the success of La Casa de los Pájaros. For this, Mompou completed the full set of 12 variations in 1957. The latter ballet was never produced, and the music was published as Variations on a Theme of Chopin, without any reference to any balletic connections.

,,,,,,,,,,,Piano Quartet (Schumann),Schumann,"The Piano Quartet in E major, Op. 47, was composed by Robert Schumann in 1842 for piano, violin, viola and cello. Written during a productive period in which he produced several large-scale chamber music works, it has been described as the ""creative double"" of his Piano Quintet, finished weeks earlier. Though dedicated to the Russian cellist Mathieu Wielhorsky, it was written with Schumann's wife Clara in mind, who would be the pianist at the premiere on 8 December 1844 in Leipzig. The work consists of four movements. The first movement is in sonata form and begins with a hymn-like introduction that leads to a more figural section. The second movement, a scherzo, features a quick staccato figure that moves around a G minor scale, with two contrasting trio sections. The third movement (Andante cantabile) has been called the highlight of the work, with one of the most beautiful cello themes of the Romantic period. The finale includes contrapunctal writing and makes many references to the preceding movements. At the premiere, the Piano Quartet was well received. Today, it is recognized as the culmination of virtually all previous exploration of the piano quartet as a genre up to that time, forming the foundations for later composers to build on.",Robert Schumann,E-flat major,,47,,,,four

The piece achieved instant and long-lasting popularity on its appearance on the concert stage in 1929. It is an example of symphonic jazz, not unlike the style of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, although it is very much Lambert's individual conception. It combines jazzy syncopation with lithe Latin American dance rhythms that create an air of haunting nostalgia. The Rio Grande takes roughly 15 to 20 minutes to perform. It was dedicated to Angus Morrison, who played at its first (broadcast) performance. No other work of Lambert's achieved the level of popularity achieved by The Rio Grande. It is still performed regularly today, at the BBC Proms (including the Last Night) and by choral societies in the UK and abroad.",,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,Piano Sonata No. 16 (Beethoven),Beethoven,"Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 16 in G major, Op. 31, No. 1, was composed between 1801 and 1802. Although it was numbered as the first piece in the trio of piano sonatas which were published as Opus 31 in 1803, Beethoven actually finished it after the Op. 31 No. 2, the Tempest Sonata. Due to his dissatisfaction with the classical style of music, Beethoven pledged to take a new path of musical composition and style. The Opus 31 works are the first examples of the new and unconventional ideas Beethoven adopted in an attempt to make a name for himself. For example, in the first movement, unlike most sonata allegro forms in which the second theme of the exposition is dominant, the second theme is in B major and B minor, the mediant of the original key. Beethoven would later continue to use the mediant and submediant as expositional goals for major-key sonata-form movements, such as the first movements of the Waldstein and Hammerklavier sonatas, the Archduke trio, the triple concerto and the thirteenth string quartet, as well as the finale to the seventh symphony. These pieces were written after Beethoven's Heiligenstadt Testament of 1802. This sonata is light and breezy and has touches of humour and irony in its movements. Critics say that the Opus 31 works show a more pronounced ""Beethovenian"" sense of style that became more evident in his later, mature works.",,,,,,,,

He became an organist and choirmaster at several well-known churches in Paris, and at the same time was a professor in the Conservatoire, teaching harmony from 1871 to 1891 and composition from 1891 to 1896, when he succeeded Ambroise Thomas as the Conservatoire's director. He continued his predecessor's strictly conservative curriculum and was forced to retire early after a scandal erupted over the faculty's attempt to rig the Prix de Rome competition to prevent the modernist Maurice Ravel from winning. As a composer, Dubois was seen as capable and tasteful, but not strikingly original or inspired. He hoped for a career as an opera composer, but became better known for his church compositions.

Shostakovich began composing the sonata while he and his family were evacuated in Kuybyshev (present-day Samara). A few months before, he heard about the death of his former piano teacher Leonid Nikolayev, which affected him profoundly; the sonata is dedicated to his memory. Originally, Shostakovich had planned a four-movement sonata in C-sharp minor, but by March 1943 had abandoned that idea in favor of the work's final three-movement form. Shostakovich premiered the sonata in Moscow on June 6, 1943. The sonata was received with mixed reviews. Ivan Sollertinsky felt it was one of the finest of all of Shostakovich's works. Emil Gilels, an important champion of the sonata, expressed disappointment and compared it unfavorably to Shostakovich's symphonies. Shostakovich himself was unsure of the work's quality; it was one of the few piano works from his maturity that he never recorded.

The two pieces were published simultaneously in August 1839, although not as a set. the wife of Major Anton Serre, who together lent Schumann great encouragement in his romance with Clara Wieck, despite being close friends of her father Friedrich Wieck, who was implacably opposed to the marriage. Blumenstück features a falling four-note motif that Schumann had previously used to refer to Clara Wieck in Carnaval, Op. 9. Rather than in his manuscript book, Schumann sketched Blumenstück in his Brautbuch; it was offered, along with the song cycle Myrthen, Op. 25, of 1840, as a bridal gift. In a letter to Clara on 24 January 1839, Schumann wrote that he had recently completed a number of small piano pieces, with the titles: * Guirlande (""variations, but not on a theme""; this could be a mistranslation of ""but not on one theme"", meaning ""but not on a single theme"") * Rondolette, and * ""other small things, of which I have so many, and which I shall chain together prettily under the title Kleine Blumenstücke, much like one might name a series of pictures"".

,,,,,,,,,,,Evryali,,"Evryali (from Euryale) is a piece for solo piano composed by Iannis Xenakis in 1973. It is based on a technique Xenakis invented in early 1970s, called arborescences&mdash;proliferations of melodic lines created from a generative contour. The title refers to the name of one of the Gorgon sisters, and is also Greek for open sea. Written in 1973, Evryali was Xenakis' second major work for piano solo after Herma, written in 1961. Evryali was composed for, and dedicated to, pianist Marie-Françoise Bucquet. According to her, upon presenting her the score, Xenakis said: ""Here's the piece. Look at it, and if you think you can do something with it, play it"". Conventional notation is used throughout the score; however, instead of using two or three staves as is customary for piano scores, Xenakis frequently employs four and five staves. Numerous passages are impossible to play as written either because it is physically impossible to reach the notes, or, in one case (a C-sharp in the penultimate passage of arborescences), because the written note is not available on most pianos (this particular difficulty was rectified in a later edition of the work). Therefore, the performer has to create a reduction of the piece, omitting some notes, transposing others, etc., in order to make it playable. Citing these and other difficulties of Evryali, pianist-composer Marc Couroux compares the performer to the ""warrior"" from Carlos Castaneda's books: when confronted with the piece, one must remain ""lucid"" and choose ""which aspects [of the piece] are essential and must be preserved"", and which must be sacrificed. The music consists almost entirely of a limited number of distinct kinds of texture. On the most basic level, one can distinguish five of these: fixed rhythmic passages, stochastic clouds, polyphonic arborescences, monophonic waves and silence. Chung offers different names for the textures, but with essentially the same content). A more complex analysis, offered by musicologist Ronald Squibbs, reveals that Evryali has four distinct ""configuration types"". The first is derived from applying set theory to time-point sequences, each of which is then assigned to a specific pitch. This is the configuration type the work starts with. The second type is generated by stochastic methods, arborescences constitute the third, and finally, the fourth configuration type is silence. According to this classification, there are fifty segments overall in Evryali: 23 for time-point sequences, 4 for stochastic material (appearing only at two points in the work, both times as consecutive pairs), 20 for arborescences, and 3 are silences. In the score, the silences are notated in seconds. In adopting a single tempo throughout, Evryali is unique in Xenakis' oeuvre for solo piano. Evryali is connected to earlier works, particularly Synaphaï (1969), certain parts of which led to the creation of the arborescence technique. Several passages from Evryali were later reused, with some modification, in the chamber work Dikhthas (1979).",,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,Symphony for Solo Piano (Alkan),Alkan,"The Symphony for Solo Piano is a large-scale romantic work for piano composed by Charles-Valentin Alkan and published in 1857. Although it is generally performed as a self-contained work, it comprises études Nos. 4–7 from the Douze études dans tous les tons mineurs (Twelve Studies in All the Minor Keys), Op. 39, each title containing the word Symphonie (French: Symphony). The four movements are titled Allegro moderato, Marche funèbre, Menuet, and Finale. Much like the Concerto for Solo Piano (Nos. 8–10), the Symphony is written so as to evoke the broad palette of timbres and harmonic textures available to an orchestra. It is an early example of a piano symphony. In the opinion of François Luguenot, it ""does not contain the excesses of [Alkan's] Concerto or the Grande Sonate (Op. 33). But, rather like [Alkan's] Sonatine Op. 61, it proves that Alkan was also capable of writing perfectly balanced and almost ‘Classical’ works."" Unlike a standard classical symphony, each movement is in a different key, rising in progressive tonality by a perfect fourth.",,,,,,,,

On the set, Schumann wrote: ""The titles for pieces of music, since they again have come into favor in our day, have been censured here and there, and it has been said that 'good music needs no sign-post.' Certainly not, but neither does a title rob it of its value; and the composer, by adding one, at least prevents a complete misunderstanding of the character of his music.

,,,,,,,,,,,Variations in E-flat major (Beethoven),Beethoven,"The Variations in E-flat major piano trio, Op. 44, by Ludwig van Beethoven, is a series of fourteen variations on a theme, written for piano, violin and cello. Although this may be one of Beethoven's early works (written circa 1792, i.e., at around age 22) it was assigned its opus number when it was published by Hoffmeister in Leipzig, more than a decade after Beethoven began writing it. Following common practice at the time, in this work Beethoven incorporated variations on popular themes from opera, notably from ' (literally translated as The Red Cap), a Singspiel by Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf, which had its premiere in Vienna in 1788. The opera reached Bonn in 1792, during the last months that Beethoven stayed there. Beethoven took one of the most popular pieces of this opera, a small segment of melody of ' (Yes, I must leave her), as the starting point for this trio. This line is from an aria sung by the village mayor Hans Christoph Nitsche, who is announces that he must leave his wife. Beethoven's variations were probably finished when he left Bonn &ndash; a short sketch from 1792 has survived &ndash; but were published as Op. 44 in 1804. The theme is a series of simple unadorned arpeggios in octave unisons by all three players. Beethoven then develops fourteen variations, decorative in the tradition of the eighteenth century but with contrasting spirit and textures employed. The tenth variation, syncopated and vigorous, is followed by an almost exaggeratedly reserved dialogue while the twelfth variation's gentle ambling is interrupted by a burst of coarse fortissimo. This work includes two slow variations in E-flat minor (Nos 7 and 13). The final variation begins allegro in 6/8, dynamic and joyful, interrupted by a brief interlude marked andante. The conclusion is marked presto, led by the piano. The playing time of these variations is usually 13 to 14 minutes.",,,,,,,,

He published it anonymously as ""Pianoforte Sonata, dedicated to Clara by Florestan and Eusebius"". Eric Frederick Jensen describes the sonata as 'the most unconventional and the most intriguing' of Schumann's piano sonatas due to its unusual structure. The Aria is based on his earlier Lied setting, ""An Anna"" or ""Nicht im Tale"". Schumann later told his wife, Clara, that the sonata was ""a solitary outcry for you from my heart ... in which your theme appears in every possible shape"". The four movements are as follows:",,,,,,,,

Liszt believed that the work was rich and powerful. In 1853 Schumann revised the work and added a Scherzo as a second movement, which the performer could choose to play, or not play. In 1861 it was released into the hands of Johannes Brahms. The autograph manuscript of the sonata is preserved in the British Library.",,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,Variations on a Theme by Haydn,,"The Variations on a Theme by Joseph Haydn (), now also called the Saint Anthony Variations, is a work in the form of a theme and variations, composed by Johannes Brahms in the summer of 1873 at Tutzing in Bavaria. It consists of a theme in B major based on a ""Chorale St Antoni"", eight variations, and a finale. The work was published in two versions: for two pianos, written first but designated Op.&nbsp;56b; and for orchestra, designated Op.&nbsp;56a. The orchestral version is better known and much more often heard than the two-piano version. The first performance of the orchestral version was given on 2 November 1873 by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra under Brahms's baton. It is often said to be the first independent set of variations for orchestra in the history of music, although there is at least one earlier piece in the same form, Antonio Salieri's Twenty-six Variations on 'La folia di Spagna written in 1815.",,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,Piano Trio No. 39 (Haydn),Haydn,"(1791)]] Joseph Haydn's Piano Trio No. 39 in G major, Hob. XV/25 was written in 1795, during the final few weeks of Haydn's second trip to London, and one of a set of three (H. XV:24–26) dedicated to Rebecca Schroeter. It is perhaps his best-known piano trio and sometimes nicknamed the ""Gypsy"" or ""Gypsy Rondo"" trio because of its Rondo finale in 'Hungarian' style. The trio is in three movements: Rosemary Hughes describes the first movement as ""a curious but charming blend of double-variation and rondo, for the two minor sections are extremely free in their connection either with the major main theme or with each other. The alternation of variations in major and minor keys is characteristic of Haydn. The second movement, which continues the gentle mood, is noted for the violin melody in the central section. This was a particular favourite of cellist Pablo Casals, who (ignoring the score) used to take over from the violinist on the repeat. The work was published in October 1795 by the English firm of Longman and Broderip as part of a set of three with the opus number (seldom used today) 73. The other two are No. 38 in D major (Hoboken XV:24) and No. 40 in F minor, (Hoboken XV:26). All are dedicated to Haydn's friend, the widow Rebecca Schroeter.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,In the Mists,,"In the Mists () is a piano cycle by Czech composer Leoš Janáček, the last of his more substantial solo works for the instrument. It was composed in 1912, some years after Janáček had suffered the death of his daughter Olga and while his operas were still being rejected by the Prague opera houses. All four parts of the cycle are largely written in ""misty"" keys with five or six flats; characteristic of the cycle are the frequent changes of meter. Czech musicologist Jiří Zahrádka compared the atmosphere of the cycle to impressionist works, in particular those of Claude Debussy. The première took place on 7 December 1913, when Marie Dvořáková played it at a concert organized by the choral society Moravan in Kroměříž. On January 24, 1914, the cycle had its first public performance at the third concert of the Organ School in Brno by pianist Marie Dvořáková, teacher of the school.",Leoš Janáček,,,,,,,4

,,,,,,,,,,,Easter Sonata,,"]] The Easter Sonata () is a piano sonata in the key of A major, composed by Fanny Mendelssohn. It was lost for 150 years and when found attributed to her brother Felix, before finally being recognized as hers. It premiered in her name on 7 September 2012, played by Andrea Lam. It received a second performance by Sofya Gulyak on 8 March 2017 for BBC Radio 3. It was the second sonata composed by Fanny Mendelssohn and was completed in 1828. During most of her lifetime, Fanny Mendelssohn's works remained unpublished. A few were published under her brother's name, with her knowledge and consent. The Easter Sonata was not published, but is mentioned as her work in her diary and letters written to her family members in 1829. The manuscript, which is signed ""F. Mendelssohn"", was found in France in 1970 and the piece was recorded for the first time in 1972 by Éric Heidsieck, attributed to Felix Mendelssohn. Some musicologists suggested that the piece might be by Fanny Mendelssohn, but the proposal was not seriously considered by most because of the lack of a known autograph manuscript. In 2010 the manuscript was examined by Angela Mace Christian who verified that the manuscript was in Fanny Mendelssohn's handwriting and determined that it had been cut from her book of compositions. In May 2020, the Easter Sonata was recorded under Fanny Mendelssohn's name for the first time by pianist Gaia Sokoli (Piano Classics, 2021). The sonata depicts the Passion of Christ and the second movement contains an ""ecclesiastical fugue"". The Finale expresses the moment of Christ's death when the curtain of the Temple is rent asunder, and ends with a fantasy on the chorale tune ""Christe, du Lamm Gottes"" (""Christ, thou Lamb of God"").",,,,,,,,
